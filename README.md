# Early Christian Sources 

This website is created to contain references and links (when available on the Internet) to primary sources of information about early Christianity, especially the writings of early (pre-Nicene) Christians in various languages. The early Christian writings which are contained in the New Testament are not included here because they are so easily accessible in so many languages. It is hoped that this site will assist those who wish to learn more about the lives and beliefs of the early Christians from their own words.

# Early Christian Sources 

The web site is created to contain references and links (when available on the Internet) to primary sources about early (pre-Nicene) Christians in various languages. It is hoped that this site will assist those who wish to learn more about the lives and beliefs of the early Christians from the words of those of them whose writings we still have.

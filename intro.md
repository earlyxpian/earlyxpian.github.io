# Introduction to the Early Christian Writings

### What Are the Early Christian Writings?

There are volumes of writings by early Christians which have survived to today. In addition to the early Christian writings which became the New Testament of the Christian Bible, there are many times more from about the same time and from the following generations which are still available. These writings take on different forms: some are instructions on how to live and what to believe; some are letters of correction or encouragement; some are introductions to Christianity to interested seekers; some are defences of Christianity to Roman authorities; some are commentary on the Bible; some are accounts of early Christian martyrs; there is even a message which was spoken to a group of early Christians in one of their gatherings.

This website is dedicated to the writings of the early Christians up to about the time of Constantine making Christianity the official religion of Rome and the time of the council of Nicaea. This cutoff has been chosen for a few reasons: first, the changes in Christianity leading up to Constantine's involvement with it were so significant that by that time Christianity had taken on such a different focus and character than it had at first; this makes it hard to trust much of what was written after that point as being a reliable guide to what Christianity had originally been. This is not to say that everything we have before that point was good and everything after bad. Second, the largest collections of early Christian Writings have used this cutoff of before and after Nicaea.

This website also does not include writings which clearly come from Gnostic sects, even though they claimed to be following Jesus. Some exceptions to this may be contained in large collections of early Christian writings hosted on this website in which the authors chose to include some Gnostic writings.

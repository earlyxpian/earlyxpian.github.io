<h1 class="title">Descriptions of Christianity From the Surviving Writings of First &amp; Second Century Christians</h1>
</header>
<p>If you were to give a summary of the basics of Christianity, what would you include and what would you leave out? Would Jesus’s teachings be the focus, or would something else be the main emphasis? If you wanted to describe what Christianity looked like to an outsider, what would that description include? If you were trying to convince a skeptic that the lives of Christians are very different than the lives of other people, what would you point to in order to demonstrate this?</p>
<p>In the New Testament we have primarily, if not exclusively, writings written to other Christians by early disciples. The accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are general enough that they can be understood by someone with little or no background in Christianity. However, the rest of the New Testament assumes significant background knowledge of the people they were written to. What would Peter, John, Paul, or one of the other first disciples have written if they had been trying to give a summary of Christianity to outsiders? We can get glimpses of this from Luke’s accounts in the book of Acts. Otherwise, we can only speculate about what exactly they would have said.</p>
<p>The following excerpts are from the writings of early Christians who immediately followed the first disciples. These writings were written between the late first century and the late second century. These have been selected because they give summaries of Christianity from an early Christian perspective. Most of them are from early Christian apologies—writings which give a defense of Christianity to interested outsiders or even hostile authorities. Some of these excerpts are from letters written from one Christian assembly to another.</p>
<p>What these excerpts all have in common is that they describe something that few people today have seen or known. The beliefs they mention, although having some overlap with the teachings of various groups today which claim to be Christian, have some major differences. Sometimes they are different in focus—emphasizing things that many today would consider to be secondary issues at best. Sometimes they are so different from what many who profess Christ today believe that they are incompatible.</p>
<p>Although these excerpts contain beliefs which are different from what many believe today, where they are most remarkable is in the lifestyle they describe. It is uncommon today for those who profess to be Christians to be viewed as strangers and foreigners in the countries of their birth. It is also uncommon for them to be known for radical obedience to Jesus’s more difficult and counter-cultural commands.</p>
<p>Consider as you read these excerpts what the world today could be like if what was said of Christians in these excerpts could be honestly said of most who take that name today.</p>
<p>The first excerpt is from a letter written by the Christians in Rome to the Christian assembly in Corinth. The letter was probably written around the end of the first century, probably not long after John recorded his revelation and returned from exile on the Island of Patmos. It is either the oldest surviving Christian writing outside of the New Testament or close to the oldest. Since the second century, the letter has been attributed to Clement, an early overseer in Rome and possibly the companion of Paul with that name<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The reason for this letter is a serious problem that happened in Corinth where the elders had been forced from their positions by some rebellious younger men in the assembly. This letter is focused on correcting that error, rebuking those involved and calling them to repentance. Clement warns that the rebellious, if they do not repent, will be excluded from Christ’s hope. However, before starting to address the sad situation in Corinth, he describes what the lives of the Christians in Corinth had looked like before this serious fall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has anyone, indeed, stayed with you without attesting the excellence and firmness of your faith? without admiring your sensible and considerate Christian piety? without broadcasting your spirit of unbounded hospitality? without praising your perfect and trustworthy knowledge? For you always acted without partiality and walked in God’s laws. You obeyed your rulers and gave your elders the proper respect. You disciplined the minds of your young people in moderation and dignity. You instructed your women to do everything with a blameless and pure conscience, and to give their husbands the affection they should. You taught them, too, to abide by the rule of obedience and to run their homes with dignity and thorough discretion.</p>
<p>You were all humble and without any pretensions, obeying orders rather than issuing them, more gladly giving than receiving. Content with Christ’s rations and mindful of them, you stored his words carefully up in your hearts and held his sufferings before your eyes.</p>
<p>In consequence, you were all granted a profound and rich peace and an insatiable longing to do good, while the Holy Spirit was abundantly poured out on you all. You were full of holy counsels, and, with zeal for the good and devout confidence, you stretched out your hands to almighty God, beseeching him to have mercy should you involuntarily have fallen into any sin. Day and night you labored for the whole brotherhood, that by your pity and sympathy the sum of his elect might be saved. You were sincere and guileless and bore no grudges. All sedition and schism were an abomination to you. You wept for the faults of your neighbors, while you reckoned their shortcomings as your own. You never regretted all the good you did, being ready for any good deed. Possessed of an excellent and devout character, you did everything in His fear. The commands and decrees of the Lord were engraven on the tablets of your heart.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following excerpt is from a letter written by Polycarp, an overseer from Smyrna. He wrote this letter to the Christian assembly in Philippi some time in the first half of the second century. In this excerpt, Polycarp contrasts the “empty talkativeness and the erroneous teachings of the crowd” with the true way. He gives a brief summary of what God requires of people in order to obtain eternal life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, girding your loins, serve God in fear and in truth, forsaking empty talkativeness and the erroneous teaching of the crowd, believing on him who raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead and gave him glory and a throne on his right hand; to whom he subjected all things, whether in heaven or on earth, whom everything that breathes serves, who will come as judge of the living and the dead, whose blood God will require from those who disobey him. For he who raised him from the dead will raise us also, if we do his will and follow his commandments, and love what he loved, refraining from all wrongdoing, avarice, love of money, slander, and false witness; not returning evil for evil or abuse for abuse, or blow for blow, or curse for curse; but rather remembering what the Lord said when he taught: Judge not, that you be not judged; forgive, and you will be forgiven; be merciful, that you may be shown mercy; the measure you give will be the measure you get; and blessed are the poor and those persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of God.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several early Christian writings contain a detailed description of two ways: “the way of life” and “the way of death”. <em>The Letter of Barnabas</em>, <em>The Didache</em> (which means <em>the teaching</em> and is also called <em>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</em>) and a Latin translation of the two ways all contain very similar descriptions of these two ways. Likely these different forms represent evolution of an initial idea but all are generally thought to be from the first or early second centuries. The following excerpt is “the way of life” from <em>The Didache</em>, something that <em>The Didache</em> says was taught to those who wanted to become Christians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two ways, one of life and one of death; and between the two ways there is a great difference.</p>
<p>Now, this is the way of life: First, you must love God who made you, and second, your neighbor as yourself. And whatever you want people to refrain from doing to you, you must not do to them.</p>
<p>What these maxims teach is this: Bless those who curse you, and pray for your enemies. Moreover, fast for those who persecute you. For what credit is it to you if you love those who love you? Is that not the way the heathen act? But you must love those who hate you, and then you will make no enemies. Abstain from fleshly passions. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other too, and you will be perfect. If someone forces you to go one mile with him, go along with him for two; if someone robs you of your overcoat, give him your suit as well. If someone deprives you of your property, do not ask for it back. (You could not get it back anyway!) Give to everybody who begs from you, and ask for no return. For the Father wants his own gifts to be universally shared. Happy is the man who gives as the commandment bids him, for he is guiltless! But alas for the man who receives! If he receives because he is in need, he will be guiltless. But if he is not in need he will have to stand trial why he received and for what purpose. He will be thrown into prison and have his action investigated; and he will not get out until he has paid back the last cent. Indeed, there is a further saying that relates to this: “Let your donation sweat in your hands until you know to whom to give it.”</p>
<p>The second commandment of the Teaching: Do not murder; do not commit adultery; do not corrupt boys; do not fornicate; do not steal; do not practice magic; do not go in for sorcery; do not murder a child by abortion or kill a new-born infant. Do not covet your neighbor’s property; do not commit perjury; do not bear false witness; do not slander; do not bear grudges. Do not be double-minded or double-tongued, for a double tongue is a deadly snare. Your words shall not be dishonest or hollow, but substantiated by action. Do not be greedy or extortionate or hypocritical or malicious or arrogant. Do not plot against your neighbor. Do not hate anybody; but reprove some, pray for others, and still others love more than your own life.</p>
<p>My child, flee from all wickedness and from everything of that sort. Do not be irritable, for anger leads to murder. Do not be jealous or contentious or impetuous, for all this breeds murder.</p>
<p>My child, do not be lustful, for lust leads to fornication. Do not use foul language or leer, for all this breeds adultery.</p>
<p>My child, do not be a diviner, for that leads to idolatry. Do not be an enchanter or an astrologer or a magician. Moreover, have no wish to observe or heed such practices, for all this breeds idolatry.</p>
<p>My child, do not be a liar, for lying leads to theft. Do not be greedy or vain, for all this breeds thievery.</p>
<p>My child, do not be a grumbler, for grumbling leads to blasphemy. Do not be stubborn or evil-minded, for all this breeds blasphemy.</p>
<p>But be humble since the humble will inherit the earth. Be patient, merciful, harmless, quiet, and good; and always have respect for the teaching you have been given. Do not put on airs or give yourself up to presumptuousness. Do not associate with the high and mighty; but be with the upright and humble. Accept whatever happens to you as good, in the realization that nothing occurs apart from God.</p>
<p>My child, day and night you should remember him who preaches God’s word to you, and honor him as you would the Lord. For where the Lord’s nature is discussed, there the Lord is. Every day you should seek the company of saints to enjoy their refreshing conversation. You must not start a schism, but reconcile those at strife. Your judgments must be fair. You must not play favorites when reproving transgressions. You must not be of two minds about your decision.</p>
<p>Do not be one who holds his hand out to take, but shuts it when it comes to giving. If your labor has brought you earnings, pay a ransom for your sins. Do not hesitate to give and do not give with a bad grace; for you will discover who He is that pays you back a reward with a good grace. Do not turn your back on the needy, but share everything with your brother and call nothing your own. For if you have what is eternal in common, how much more should you have what is transient!</p>
<p>Do not neglect your responsibility to your son or your daughter, but from their youth you shall teach them to revere God. Do not be harsh in giving orders to your slaves and slave girls. They hope in the same God as you, and the result may be that they cease to revere the God over you both. For when he comes to call us, he will not respect our station, but will call those whom the Spirit has made ready. You slaves, for your part, must obey your masters with reverence and fear, as if they represented God.</p>
<p>You must hate all hypocrisy and everything which fails to please the Lord. You must not forsake the Lord’s commandments, but observe the ones you have been given, neither adding nor subtracting anything. At the church meeting you must confess your sins, and not approach prayer with a bad conscience. That is the way of life.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The following summary of Christianity is from what is probably the earliest surviving written defense of Christianity. It was written by a man named Aristides from Athens and was presented to the Roman Emperor, probably some time around 125 A.D., although possibly as late as the middle of the second century:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christians, then, trace the beginning of their religion from Jesus the Messiah; and he is named the Son of God Most High. And it is said that God came down from heaven, and from a Hebrew virgin assumed and clothed himself with flesh; and the Son of God lived in a daughter of man. This is taught in the gospel, as it is called, which a short time ago was preached among them; and you also if you will read therein, may perceive the power which belongs to it. This Jesus, then, was born of the race of the Hebrews; and he had twelve disciples in order that the purpose of his incarnation might in time be accomplished. But he himself was pierced by the Jews, and he died and was buried; and they say that after three days he rose and ascended to heaven. Thereupon these twelve disciples went forth throughout the known parts of the world, and kept showing his greatness with all modesty and uprightness. And hence also those of the present day who believe that preaching are called Christians, and they are become famous.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But the Christians, O King, while they went about and made search, have found the truth; and as we learned from their writings, they have come nearer to truth and genuine knowledge than the rest of the nations. For they know and trust in God, the Creator of heaven and of earth, in whom and from whom are all things, to whom there is no other god as companion, from whom they received commandments which they engraved upon their minds and observe in hope and expectation of the world which is to come. Because of this they do not commit adultery nor fornication, nor bear false witness, nor embezzle what is held in pledge, nor covet what is not theirs. They honour father and mother, and show kindness to those near to them; and whenever they are judges, they judge uprightly. They do not worship idols [made] in the image of man; and whatever they would not want others to do unto them, they do not do to others; and of the food which is consecrated to idols they do not eat, for they are pure. And their oppressors they appease [lit: comfort] and make them their friends; they do good to their enemies; and their women, O King, are pure as virgins, and their daughters are modest; and their men keep themselves from every unlawful union and from all uncleanness, in the hope of a recompense to come in the other world. Further, if one or other of them have bondmen and bondwomen or children, through love towards them they persuade them to become Christians, and when they have done so, they call them brothers without distinction. They do not worship strange gods, and they go their way in all modesty and cheerfulness. Falsehood is not found among them; and they love one another, and from widows they do not turn away their esteem; and they deliver the orphan from him who treats him harshly. And he, who has, gives to him who has not, without boasting. And when they see a stranger, they take him in to their homes and rejoice over him as a very brother; for they do not call them brothers after the flesh, but brothers after the spirit and in God. And whenever one of their poor passes from the world, each one of them according to his ability gives heed to him and carefully sees to his burial. And if they hear that one of their number is imprisoned or afflicted on account of the name of their Messiah, all of them anxiously minister to his necessity, and if it is possible to redeem him they set him free. And if there is among them any that is poor and needy, and if they have no spare food, they fast two or three days in order to supply to the needy their lack of food. They observe the precepts of their Messiah with much care, living justly and soberly as the Lord their God commanded them. Every morning and every hour they give thanks and praise to God for His loving-kindnesses toward them; and for their food and their drink they offer thanksgiving to Him. And if any righteous man among them passes from the world, they rejoice and offer thanks to God; and they escort his body as if he were setting out from one place to another near. And when a child has been born to one of them, they give thanks to God; and if moreover it happen to die in childhood, they give thanks to God the more, as for one who has passed through the world without sins. And further if they see that anyone of them dies in his ungodliness or in his sins, for him they grieve bitterly, and sorrow as for one who goes to meet his doom.</p>
<p>Such, O King, is the commandment of the law of the Christians, and such is their manner of life. As men who know God, they ask from Him petitions which are fitting for Him to grant and for them to receive. And thus they employ their whole lifetime. And since they know the loving-kindnesses of God toward them, behold! for their sake the glorious things which are in the world flow forth to view. And truly, they are those who found the truth when they went about and made search for it; and from what we considered, we learned that they alone come near to a knowledge of the truth. And they do not proclaim in the ears of the multitude the kind deeds they do, but are careful that no one should notice them; and they conceal their giving just as he who finds a treasure and conceals it. And they strive to be righteous as those who expect to behold their Messiah, and to receive from Him with great glory the promises made concerning them. And as for their words and their precepts, O King, and their glorying in their worship, and the hope of earning according to the work of each one of them their recompense which they look for in another world, you may learn about these from their writings. It is enough for us to have shortly informed your Majesty concerning the conduct and the truth of the Christians. For great indeed, and wonderful is their doctrine to him who will search into it and reflect upon it. And truly, this is a new people, and there is something divine [lit: a divine admixture] in the midst of them.</p>
<p>Take, then, their writings, and read therein, and look: you will find that I have not put forth these things on my own authority, nor spoken thus as their advocate; but since I read in their writings I was fully assured of these things as also of things which are to come. And for this reason I was constrained to declare the truth to such as care for it and seek the world to come. And to me there is no doubt but that the earth abides through the supplication of the Christians. But the rest of the nations err and cause error in wallowing before the elements of the world, since beyond these their mental vision will not pass. And they search about as if in darkness because they will not recognize the truth; and like drunken men they reel and jostle one another and fall.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The following excerpt is from the <em>First Apology</em> of Justin the Martyr. Justin was a Christian from a non-Jewish family in Samaria. He was initially a student of philosophy but converted to Christianity after being challenged by a stranger on a walk one day to consider Christianity. He was killed for his faith by the Roman government some time between 160 and 170 A.D. This apology is a defense and description of Christianity which he wrote some time around the middle of the second century to the Roman Emperor Antoninus. In it he gives a summary of Christian belief and practice and counters the false claim that the Christians were atheists. It seems they were accused of this because they had no temples and offered no sacrifices or incense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What sound-minded man will not admit that we are not godless, since we worship the Fashioner of the universe, declaring him, as we have been taught, to have no need of blood and libations and incense, but praising him by the word of prayer and thanksgiving for all that he has given us? We have learned that the only honor worthy of him is, not to consume by fire the things he has made for our nourishment, but to devote them to our use and those in need, in thankfulness to him sending up solemn prayers and hymns for our creation and all the means of health, for the variety of creatures and the changes of the seasons, and sending up our petitions that we may live again in incorruption through our faith in him. It is Jesus Christ who has taught us these things, having been born for this purpose and crucified under Pontius Pilate, who was procurator in Judea in the time of Tiberius Caesar. We will show that we honor him in accordance with reason, having learned that he is the Son of the true God himself, and holding him to be in the second place and the prophetic Spirit in the third rank. It is for this that they charge us with madness, saying that we give the second place after the unchanging and ever-existing God and begetter of all things to a crucified man, not knowing the mystery involved in this, to which we ask you to give your attention as we expound it.</p>
<p>We warn you in advance to be careful, lest the demons whom we have attacked should deceive you and prevent your completely grasping and understanding what we say. For they struggle to have you as their slaves and servants, and now by manifestations in dreams, now by magic tricks, they get hold of all who do not struggle to their utmost for their own salvation—as we do who, after being persuaded by the Word, renounced them and now follow the only unbegotten God through his Son. Those who once rejoiced in fornication now delight in continence alone; those who made use of magic arts have dedicated themselves to the good and unbegotten God; we who once took most pleasure in the means of increasing our wealth and property now bring what we have into a common fund and share with everyone in need; we who hated and killed one another and would not associate with men of different tribes because of [their different] customs, now after the manifestation of Christ live together and pray for our enemies and try to persuade those who unjustly hate us, so that they, living according to the fair commands of Christ, may share with us the good hope of receiving the same things [that we will] from God, the master of all. So that this may not seem to be sophistry, I think fit before giving our demonstration to recall a few of the teachings which have come from Christ himself. It is for you then, as mighty emperors, to examine whether we have been taught and do teach these things truly. His sayings were short and concise, for he was no sophist, but his word was the power of God.</p>
<p>About continence he said this: “Whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery in his heart before God.” And: “If your right eye offends you, cut it out; it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with one eye than with two to be sent into eternal fire.” And: “Whoever marries a woman who has been put away from another man commits adultery.” And: “There are some who were made eunuchs by men, and some who were born eunuchs, and some who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake; only not all [are able to] receive this.”</p>
<p>And so those who make second marriages according to human law are sinners in the sight of our Teacher, and those who look on a woman to lust after her. For he condemns not only the man who commits the act of adultery, but the man who desires to commit adultery, since not only our actions but our thoughts are manifest to God. Many men and women now in their sixties and seventies who have been disciples of Christ from childhood have preserved their purity; and I am proud that I could point to such people in every nation. Then what shall we say of the uncounted multitude of those who have turned away from unrestrained living and learned these things? For Christ did not call the righteous or the self-controlled to repentance, but the ungodly and unrestrained and unrighteous. So he said: “I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” For the Heavenly Father wishes the repentance of a sinner rather than his punishment.</p>
<p>This is what he taught on affection for all men: “If you love those who love you, what new thing do you do? for even the harlots do this. But I say to you, Pray for your enemies and love those who hate you and bless those who curse you and pray for those who treat you spitefully.”</p>
<p>That we should share with those in need and do nothing for [our] glory he said these things: “Give to everyone who asks and turn not away him who wishes to borrow. For if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what new thing do you do? Even the tax collectors do this. But as for you, do not lay up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break in, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts. For what will it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world, but lose his own soul? Or what will he give in exchange for it? Lay up treasures therefore in the heavens, where neither moth nor rust corrupts.” And: “Be kind and merciful, as your Father is kind and merciful, and makes his sun to rise on sinners and righteous and wicked. Do not worry as to what you will eat or what you will wear. Are you not better than the birds and the beasts? and God feeds them. So do not worry as to what you will eat or what you will wear, for your Heavenly Father knows that you need these things. But seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and all these things will be added to you. For where his treasure is, there is the mind of man.” And: “Do not do these things to be seen of men, for otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.”</p>
<p>About being long-suffering and servants to all and free from anger, this is what he said: “To him that strikes you on one cheek turn the other also, and to him that takes away your cloak do not deny your tunic either. Whoever is angry is worthy of the fire. And whoever compels you to go one mile, follow him for two. Let your good works shine before men, that they as they see may wonder at your Father who is in heaven.”</p>
<p>For we ought not to quarrel; he has not wished us to imitate the wicked, but rather by our patience and meekness to draw all men from shame and evil desires. This we can show in the case of many who were once on your side but have turned from the ways of violence and tyranny, overcome by observing the consistent lives of their neighbors, or noting the strange patience of their injured acquaintances, or experiencing the way they did business with them.</p>
<p>About not swearing at all, but always speaking the truth, this is what he commanded: “Swear not at all; but let your yes be yes and your no no. What is more than these is from the evil one.”</p>
<p>That God only should be worshiped he showed us when he said: “The greatest commandment is: You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve with all your heart and all your strength, the Lord who made you.” And: “When one came to him and said, Good Teacher, he answered and said, There is none good, except only God who made all things.”</p>
<p>Those who are found not living as he taught should know that they are not really Christians, even if his teachings are on their lips, for he said that not those who merely profess but those who also do the works will be saved. For he said this: “Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. For whoever hears me and does what I say hears him who sent me. Many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not eat in your name and drink and do mighty works? And then I will say to them, Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness. Then there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when the righteous will shine as the sun, but the wicked will be sent into eternal fire. For many will come in my name clothed outwardly in sheep’s clothing, but being inwardly ravening wolves; by their works you will know them. Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following excerpt is from <em>A Plea Regarding Christians</em> written by Athenagoras of Athens. He addressed this defense of Christianity to the two Roman Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Aurelius Commodus. Like other early Christian apologists, he is countering false claims about the Christians, such as that they were atheists. He probably wrote this plea around 176-177 A.D.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not be surprised that I go into detail about our teaching. I give a full report to prevent your being carried away by popular and irrational opinion, and so that you may know the truth. Moreover, by showing that the teachings themselves, to which we are attached, are not human, but were declared and taught by God, we can persuade you not to hold us for atheists. What, then, are these teachings in which we are reared? “I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and sends his rain on the just and on the unjust.”</p>
<p>Although what I have said has raised a loud clamor, permit me here to proceed freely, since I am making my defense to emperors who are philosophers. Who of those who analyze syllogisms, resolve ambiguities, explain etymologies, or [teach] homonyms, synonyms, predicates, axioms, and what the subject is and what the predicate—who of them do not promise to make their disciples happy through these and similar disciplines? And yet who of them have so purified their own hearts as to love their enemies instead of hating them; instead of upbraiding those who first insult them (which is certainly more usual), to bless them; and to pray for those who plot against them? On the contrary, they ever persist in delving into the evil mysteries of their sophistry, ever desirous of working some harm, making skill in oratory rather than proof by deeds their business. With us, on the contrary, you will find unlettered people, tradesmen and old women, who, though unable to express in words the advantages of our teaching, demonstrate by acts the value of their principles. For they do not rehearse speeches, but evidence good deeds. When struck, they do not strike back; when robbed, they do not sue; to those who ask, they give, and they love their neighbors as themselves.</p>
<p>If we did not think that a God ruled over the human race, would we live in such purity? The idea is impossible. But since we are persuaded that we must give an account of all our life here to God who made us and the world, we adopt a self-controlled, generous, and despised way of life. For we think that, even if we lose our lives, we shall suffer here no evil to be compared with the reward we shall receive from the great judge for a gentle, generous, and modest life.</p>
<p>Plato, indeed, has said that Minos and Rhadamanthus<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> will judge and punish the wicked; but we say that, even if a man were Minos or Rhadamanthus or their father, he could not escape God’s judgment.</p>
<p>Then there are those who think that life is this: “Eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.” They view death as a deep sleep and a forgetting—“sleep and death, twin brothers” [as the saying goes]. And men think them religious! But there are others who reckon this present life of very little value. They are guided by this alone—to know the true God and his Word, to know the unity of the Father with the Son, the fellowship of the Father with the Son, what the Spirit is, what unity exists between these three, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, and what is their distinction in unity. These it is who know that the life for which we look is far better than can be told, if we arrive at it pure from all wrongdoing. These it is whose charity extends to the point of loving not only their friends, for, the Scripture says, “If you love those who love you, and lend to those who lend to you, what credit is it to you?” Since we are such and live this way to escape condemnation, can anyone doubt that we are religious?</p>
<p>These points, however, are trifles from a great store, a few taken from many, lest we should trouble you further. For those who test honey and whey judge by a taste if the whole is good.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>The following excerpt is from a series of letters written by Theophilus of Antioch to his friend Autolycus who was a pagan Roman who had been insulting Christianity and arguing with Theophilus about Christianity. In spite of this it seems he was interested in knowing more about Christianity. Theophilus was an overseer in Antioch towards the end of the second century. In this excerpt Theophilus gives a clear description of Christian morality and uses that to show the falseness of the popular charges that the Christians engaged in scandalous sexual activity (including incest) and ate human flesh in their gatherings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we also confess that God exists, but that He is one, the creator, and maker, and fashioner of this universe; and we know that all things are arranged by His providence, but by Him alone. And we have learned a holy law; but we have as lawgiver Him who is really God, who teaches us to act righteously, and to be pious, and to do good. And concerning piety He says, “You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make unto yourself any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I am the Lord your God.” And of doing good He said: “Honour your father and your mother; that it may be well with you, and that your days may be long in the land which I the Lord God give you.” Again, concerning righteousness: “You shall not commit adultery. You shall not kill. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour. You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, you shall not covet your neighbour’s house, nor his land, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his beast of burden, nor any of his cattle, nor anything that is your neighbour’s. You shall not pervert the judgment of the poor in his cause. From every unjust matter keep far. The innocent and righteous you shall not slay; you shall not justify the wicked; and you shall not take a gift, for gifts blind the eyes of them that see and pervert righteous words.” Of this divine law, then, Moses, who also was God’s servant, was made the minister both to all the world, and chiefly to the Hebrews, who were also called Jews, whom an Egyptian king had in ancient days enslaved, and who were the righteous seed of godly and holy men—Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. God, being mindful of them, and doing marvellous and strange miracles by the hand of Moses, delivered them, and led them out of Egypt, leading them through what is called the desert; whom He also settled again in the land of Canaan, which afterwards was called Judæa, and gave them a law, and taught them these things. Of this great and wonderful law, which tends to all righteousness, the ten heads are such as we have already rehearsed.</p>
<p>Since therefore they were strangers in the land of Egypt, being by birth Hebrews from the land of Chaldæa,—for at that time, there being a famine, they were obliged to migrate to Egypt for the sake of buying food there, where also for a time they journeyed; and these things befell them in accordance with a prediction of God,—having journeyed, then, in Egypt for 430 years, when Moses was about to lead them out into the desert, God taught them by the law, saying, “You shall not afflict a stranger; for you know the heart of a stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”</p>
<p>And when the people transgressed the law which had been given to them by God, God being good and pitiful, unwilling to destroy them, in addition to His giving them the law, afterwards sent forth also prophets to them from among their brethren, to teach and remind them of the contents of the law, and to turn them to repentance, that they might sin no more. But if they persisted in their wicked deeds, He forewarned them that they should be delivered into subjection to all the kingdoms of the earth; and that this has already happened them to is manifest. Concerning repentance, then, Isaiah the prophet, generally indeed to all, but expressly to the people, says: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord his God, and he will find mercy, for He will abundantly pardon.” And another prophet, Ezekiel, says: “If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that which is right in My sight, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; but in his righteousness that he has done he shall live: for I desire not the death of the sinner, says the Lord, but that he turn from his wicked way, and live.” Again Isaiah: “You who take deep and wicked counsel, turn, that you may be saved.” And another prophet, Jeremiah: “Turn to the Lord your God, as a grape-gatherer to his basket, and you shall find mercy.” Many therefore, yes rather, countless are the sayings in the Holy Scriptures regarding repentance, God being always desirous that the race of men turn from all their sins.</p>
<p>Moreover, concerning the righteousness which the law enjoined, confirmatory utterances are found both with the prophets and in the Gospels, because they all spoke inspired by one Spirit of God. Isaiah accordingly spoke thus: “Put away the evil of your doings from your souls; learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.” And again the same prophet said: “Loose every band of wickedness, dissolve every oppressive contract, let the oppressed go free, and tear up every unrighteous bond. Deal out your bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor to your home. When you see the naked, cover him, and hide not yourself from your own flesh. Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health shall spring forth speedily, and your righteousness shall go before you.” In like manner also Jeremiah says: “Stand in the ways, and see, and ask which is the good way of the Lord your God, and walk in it and you shall find rest for your souls. Judge just judgment, for in this is the will of the Lord your God.” So also says Hosea: “Keep judgment, and draw near to your God, who established the heavens and created the earth.”And another, Joel, spoke in agreement with these: “Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children that are in arms; let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet, and pray to the Lord thy God urgently that he may have mercy upon you, and blot out your sins.” In like manner also another, Zachariah: “Thus says the Lord Almighty, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother; and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, nor the stranger; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart, says the Lord Almighty.”</p>
<p>And concerning chastity, the holy word teaches us not only not to sin in act, but not even in thought, not even in the heart to think of any evil, nor look on another man’s wife with our eyes to lust after her. Solomon, accordingly, who was a king and a prophet, said: “Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you: make straight paths for your feet.” And the voice of the Gospel teaches still more urgently concerning chastity, saying: “Whoever looks on a woman who is not his own wife, to lust after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart.” “And he that married,” says [the Gospel], “her that is divorced from her husband, commits adultery; and whosoever puts away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, caused her to commit adultery.” Because Solomon says: “Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? So he that goes in to a married woman shall not be innocent.”</p>
<p>And that we should be kindly disposed, not only towards those of our own stock, as some suppose, Isaiah the prophet said: “Say to those that hate you, and that cast you out, You are our brethren, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and be apparent in their joy.” And the Gospel says: “Love your enemies, and pray for them that spitefully use you. For if you love them who love you, what reward do you have? This do also the robbers and the tax collectors.” And those that do good it teaches not to boast, lest they become men-pleasers. For it says: “Let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing.” Moreover, concerning subjection to authorities and powers, and prayer for them, the divine word gives us instructions, in order that “we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.” And it teaches us to render all things to all, “honour to whom honour, fear to whom fear, tribute to whom tribute; to owe no man anything, but to love all.”</p>
<p>Consider, therefore, whether those who teach such things can possibly live indifferently, and be commingled in unlawful intercourse, or, most impious of all, eat human flesh, especially when we are forbidden so much as to witness shows of gladiators, lest we become partakers and abettors of murders. But neither may we see the other spectacles, lest our eyes and ears be defiled, participating in the utterances there sung. For if one should speak of cannibalism, in these spectacles the children of Thyestes and Tereus<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> are eaten; and as for adultery, both in the case of men and of gods, whom they celebrate in elegant language for honours and prizes, this is made the subject of their dramas. But far be it from Christians to conceive any such deeds; for with them temperance dwells, self-restraint is practiced, monogamy is observed, chastity is guarded, iniquity exterminated, sin rooted out, righteousness exercised, law administered, worship performed, God acknowledged: truth governs, grace guards, peace screens them; the holy word guides, wisdom teaches, life directs, God reigns. Therefore, though we have much to say regarding our manner of life, and the ordinances of God, the maker of all creation, we yet consider that we have for the present reminded you of enough to induce you to study these things, especially since you can now read [our writings] for yourself, that as you have been fond of acquiring information, you may still be studious in this direction also.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The so-called <em>Letter to Diognetus</em> is a letter written by an anonymous early Christian disciple to someone named Diognetus. Apparently Diognetus was someone who had expressed interest in learning about Christianity. The letter is generally believed to have been written some time in the second century. This excerpt is one of the most remarkable descriptions in the surviving early Christian writings of the contrast between the lives of the Christians and the lives of those around them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Christians cannot be distinguished from the rest of the human race by country or language or customs. They do not live in cities of their own; they do not use a peculiar form of speech; they do not follow an eccentric manner of life. This doctrine of theirs has not been discovered by the ingenuity or deep thought of inquisitive men, nor do they put forward a merely human teaching, as some people do. Yet, although they live in Greek and barbarian cities alike, as each man’s lot has been cast, and follow the customs of the country in clothing and food and other matters of daily living, at the same time they give proof of the remarkable and admittedly extraordinary constitution of their own commonwealth. They live in their own countries, but only as aliens. They have a share in everything as citizens, and endure everything as foreigners. Every foreign land is their fatherland, and yet for them every fatherland is a foreign land. They marry, like everyone else, and they beget children, but they do not cast out their offspring. They share their board with each other, but not their marriage bed. It is true that they are in the flesh, but they do not live according to the flesh. They busy themselves on earth, but their citizenship is in heaven. They obey the established laws, but in their own lives they go far beyond what the laws require. They love all men, and by all men are persecuted. They are unknown, and still they are condemned; they are put to death, and yet they are brought to life. They are poor, and yet they make many rich; they are completely destitute, and yet they enjoy complete abundance. They are dishonored, and in their very dishonor are glorified; they are defamed, and are vindicated. They are reviled, and yet they bless; when they are affronted, they still pay due respect. When they do good, they are punished as evildoers; undergoing punishment, they rejoice because they are brought to life. They are treated by the Jews as foreigners and enemies, and are hunted down by the Greeks; and all the time those who hate them find it impossible to justify their enmity.</p>
<p>To put it simply: What the soul is in the body, that Christians are in the world. The soul is dispersed through all the members of the body, and Christians are scattered through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, but does not belong to the body, and Christians dwell in the world, but do not belong to the world. The soul, which is invisible, is kept under guard in the visible body; in the same way, Christians are recognised when they are in the world, but their religion remains unseen. The flesh hates the soul and treats it as an enemy, even though it has suffered no wrong, because it is prevented from enjoying its pleasures; so too the world hates Christians, even though it suffers no wrong at their hands, because they range themselves against its pleasures. The soul loves the flesh that hates it, and its members; in the same way, Christians love those who hate them. The soul is shut up in the body, and yet itself holds the body together; while Christians are restrained in the world as in a prison, and yet themselves hold the world together. The soul, which is immortal, is housed in a mortal dwelling; while Christians are settled among corruptible things, to wait for the incorruptibility that will be theirs in heaven. The soul, when faring badly as to food and drink, grows better; so too Christians, when punished, day by day increase more and more. It is to no less a post than this that God has ordered them, and they must not try to evade it.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>When various groups today who claim to be Christian seek to explain what they are like to outsiders, they often use one of a few basic approaches (or a combination of these approaches).</p>
<p>One approach is to explain how similar the group is to the surrounding culture and how comfortable visitors will therefore be when they come to a meeting. They may say something along the lines of “we’re just ordinary people”, “there are no perfect people here”, or “just come as you are”. This approach commonly emphasizes things that people will enjoy about the group and its meetings: familiar music styles, familiar clothing, or common luxuries like coffee, comfortable seating, and childcare. The aim is to convince the outsider that there is not really anything too strange or uncomfortable about the group, and the implication is often that there will not be much expected of them if they choose to join.</p>
<p>Another approach is to focus on old traditions such as church structure or how meetings are conducted. These traditions are offered as a source of meaning for people and, although unfamiliar to the surrounding culture, are pointed to unapologetically because they are ancient.</p>
<p>Another common approach is to focus primarily on theological beliefs such as: very specific beliefs about the nature of God, the superiority of certain Bible translations, what exactly will happen in the end times, how exactly God brings about his part in the salvation of man, and other similar things. The typical beliefs that are emphasized are ones that do not deeply affect how people live their daily life. Groups that use this approach commonly emphasize the teaching people will hear at the meetings and how skilled the teacher is.</p>
<p>A final approach is to emphasize the power or miracles that people will see at the group’s meetings. Groups that claim to be able to do such things in their meetings often lack the power to transform the daily lives of people from unholy to holy.</p>
<p>All of these types of groups tend to focus more on the nature of their meetings and their beliefs than the nature of their lives. This is understandable as their lives are usually not much different than the lives of the more respectable members of the surrounding society.</p>
<p>Notice how the excerpts above do not follow any of these patterns. The early Christians had no problem presenting themselves as radically different than the surrounding culture. Their focus was on their lives: their righteous living and obedience to Jesus’s teachings. They emphasized their disconnection with this world and the things of this world. They emphasized their sexual purity, even of thoughts. They frequently mentioned their willingness to love even their enemies and not to try to resist those who wanted to harm them. They made clear that they were not accumulating possessions here but using what they had for the needy and so storing up treasures in heaven. They pointed out their different standard with regard to marriage, that remarriage after divorce was unlawful to them, even though allowed by their society.</p>
<p>It is not that they did not have meetings or traditions or beliefs that they thought were important. At times there was great power and healing in their midst. They did not live outside this world. However, they recognized that the lifestyle that Jesus called them to was so remarkable that it was something that could attract an interested seeker and silence a skeptic. What would the world look like if most of the people today who professed to be Christian could say the same of their lives?</p>

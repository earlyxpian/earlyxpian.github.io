      <h1 id="ii-p0.1">GENERAL EDITORS’ PREFACE</h1>
      <p id="ii-p1">The Christian Church possesses in its literature an abundant
and incomparable treasure. But it is an inheritance that
must be reclaimed by each generation. <span class="sc">The Library of Christian Classics</span> is designed to present in the English
language, and in twenty-six volumes of convenient size, a
selection of the most indispensable Christian treatises written
prior to the end of the sixteenth century.</p>
      <p id="ii-p2">The practice of giving circulation to writings selected for
superior worth or special interest was adopted at the beginning
of Christian history. The canonical Scriptures were themselves
a selection from a much wider literature. In the Patristic
era there began to appear a class of works of compilation (often
designed for ready reference in controversy) of the opinions
of well-reputed predecessors, and in the Middle Ages many
such works were produced. These medieval anthologies actually
preserve some noteworthy materials from works otherwise lost.</p>
      <p id="ii-p3">In modern times, with the increasing inability even of those
trained in universities and theological colleges to read Latin
and Greek texts with ease and familiarity, the translation of
selected portions of earlier Christian literature into modern
languages has become more necessary than ever; while the
wide range of distinguished books written in vernaculars such
as English makes selection there also needful. The efforts that
have been made to meet this need are too numerous to be noted
here, but none of these collections serves the purpose of the
reader who desires a library of representative treatises spanning
the Christian centuries as a whole. Most of them embrace
only the age of the Church Fathers, and some of them have
long been out of print. A fresh translation of a work already



<span class="pb" id="ii-Page_10"/>  <strong>{Page 10}</strong> 

translated may shed much new light upon its meaning. This
is true even of Bible translations despite the work of many
experts through the centuries. In some instances old translations
have been adopted in this series, but wherever necessary or
desirable, new ones have been made. Notes have been supplied
where these were needed to explain the author’s meaning. The
introductions provided for the several treatises and extracts
will, we believe, furnish welcome guidance.</p>

      <h1 id="iv-p0.1">PREFACE</h1>
      <p id="iv-p1">In this volume we have attempted to give new translations
of some of the basic Christian writings of the first two
centuries.
Our aim has been to render the originals in clear, idiomatic
English, and to facilitate the reading of these classics by
revising the standard paragraphs and by relegating the chapter
and verse numbers to the margins.</p>
      <p id="iv-p2">In view of the fact that most of the material in our book
has been rendered into English so frequently as well as so
recently, the translations offered cannot but reflect some
knowledge of those already published. While our work has
been done without conscious borrowing, the same turn of
phrases is likely to occur to more than one translator, and
acquaintance with previous renderings cannot be, and should
not be, eradicated from the memory.</p>
      <p id="iv-p3">We have sought to provide adequate introductory material,
and to add such notes as are necessary for understanding the
text. The lists of books are purposely more extensive than in
some other series, and are planned to aid the student who
wishes to study these particular documents more thoroughly.</p>
      <p id="iv-p4">The division of work among the contributors is indicated
by the Table of Contents. I should like to thank the general
editors for their assistance in the preparation of the manuscript
and for their many helpful suggestions; the three contributors
for their splendid co-operation; and Dr. Bard Thompson for
his help with the notes for Athenagoras.</p>

      <h1 id="v-p0.1"><i>Introduction to Early Christian Literature and Its Setting</i></h1>
      <hr/>
      <h2 id="v.i-p0.1">THE LITERATURE</h2>
      <p id="v.i-p1">The most striking facts about early Christian literature are
its rich variety and its almost exclusively Gentile authorship.
Outside the New Testament writings little belongs to the first
century, the only considerable document being Clement’s
Letter to the Church of Corinth. But the second century saw an
increasing literary activity among Christians, which swelled
to a flood toward its end.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p2">To choose the works of the first two centuries that can be
called “classics” is a difficult, even an arbitrary, task. It is the
purpose of this volume to select a number of the most notable
treatises, having in mind their representative character as well
as their intrinsic worth. Thus an early sermon has been included
despite its somewhat banal nature, while more weighty works
such as the Apologies of Tatian and Theophilus have been excluded. Justin and Athenagoras must suffice to indicate that
class of literature. It has not, however, been possible to
include every type of early Christian writing. There is no apocalypse, no apocryphal gospel, no Christian poetry. Yet the selection made will give a good indication of the temper of second
century Christianity and the quality of its literature.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p3">The earliest Christian writings after the New Testament are
customarily known under the title “Apostolic Fathers.” It is
to a French scholar of the seventeenth century,
Jean Cotelier,
that we owe this grouping. In 1672 he published two volumes
entitled <i>SS. Patrum qui temporibus apostolicis floruerunt . . . opera edita et inedita, vera et suppositicia</i>. This collection included the letter ascribed to Barnabas,
the Shepherd of Hermas, two letters of Clement (of which only one is genuine), seven of Ignatius,
and one of Polycarp,
along with the account of the latter’s

<span class="pb" id="v.i-Page_16"/>  <strong>{Page 16}</strong> 

martyrdom. All but Barnabas and Hermas will be found in this volume. Later on, the anonymous brief addressed to Diognetus and the fragments of Papias and Quadratus were added to the collection by
Andreas Gallandi in his <i>Bibliotheca veterum Patrum,</i> 1765. Finally, with the discovery of the Didache by Byrennios in 1873, this tractate too came to find a place in editions of the Apostolic Fathers.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p4">These writings do not form a unity either in date or in type.
The earliest is Clement’s
Letter, about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="v.i-p4.2"/>A.D.</span> 96. The latest are the sermon mistakenly known as his Second Letter, and the brief addressed to Diognetus.
Both these were written somewhat before the middle of the second century. Other Christian literature not included in the Apostolic Fathers also comes from this period, as, for instance, the Apology of Aristides (about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="v.i-p4.5"/>A.D.</span> 130) and the Odes of Solomon (before <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="v.i-p4.7"/>A.D.</span> 150). Yet, on the whole, the collection can be said to comprehend most of the significant Christian literature between the New Testament period and that of the great Apologists.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p5">In type, the letter predominates. Even the account of Polycarp’s
martyrdom is a letter, from the
church of Smyrna to that of
Philomelium.
The Letter of Barnabas is a theological tract, which attempts to grapple with the problem of the significance of the Old Testament for Christianity. It is a good example of the use of the epistolary form for a literary convention. Another instance is the piece addressed to Diognetus.
While it bears the title of a letter, it is really a brief for Christianity.
The earliest Christian sermon, as we have observed, is misleadingly called “Clement’s
Second Letter.” Actually, however, it is a homily, and only by accident did it get dubbed an epistle.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p6">Of the other works in this group, the Shepherd of Hermas is
an apocalpyse, dealing with repentance after baptism; the
Didache is a Church manual; while the fragments of Papias and Quadratus are from theological treatises. The former wrote five books entitled Explanations of the Lord’s Sayings. They were apparently a running commentary on Jesus’
utterances, interspersed with a good deal of oral tradition. Quadratus’
work was an apology addressed to the emperor
Hadrian.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p7">What marks these writings, taken as a whole, is their literary
simplicity, their earnest religious conviction, and their independence of Hellenistic philosophy and rhetoric. They are
closer to the New Testament in their artlessness, and while
they may lack something of its spiritual depth, they reveal an
intense concern for its basic message. They come from a time

when the Church was warring on two fronts—against pagan
attack and internal schism. Hence their peculiar concern is for
order. The unity of the Church around its leaders and the
preservation of the faith from perversion are their dominant
themes. In consequence the religious spontaneity of the New
Testament writings gives place to a more moral and ecclesiastical note.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p8">The next important group of Christian writings in the second
century is that of the Apologists. The earliest is perhaps the
brief addressed to Diognetus. There follow the Apologies of Aristides, Justin, Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus, and, by the end of the century, of Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian.
They are notable contributions to Christian literature. In Athenagoras, Clement, and Tertullian emerge writers of no small literary merit, who can vie with the best rhetoricians of the day. Their purpose is to defend the faith by making contact with the prevalent philosophies and by showing the superiority of Christianity. By means of the Logos doctrine which appears in John’s
Gospel and is clearly formulated in Justin,
they relate the revelation in Christ to a current way of thinking. But their leading theme is monotheism; and their sharpest attacks fall
on the weaknesses of the ancient mythology. They do not primarily emphasize the place of Jesus Christ in the faith. They are addressing Gentiles who are not inheritors of the Old Testament monotheism. Hence the unity of God is their first concern. Particularly is this true of Athenagoras’
Plea.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p9">A third group of early Christian writings is the apocryphal
literature.<a class="Note" id="fna_v.i-p9.1" href="#fnf_v.i-p9.1"><sup class="Note">1</sup></a> Of this a great deal has come down to us. Much of it, however, is later than the second century, and much of it is heretical in nature, being tinged with a
Docetic point of view. In general this literature is Christian romance. There are tales of Jesus and the
apostles which are told to satisfy the curiosity awakened by the paucity of incident in many of the New Testament accounts, and to meet the yearning for the miraculous. Popular folklore is blended with Gospel material, and legend upon legend is created in the style of a novelist with a pious imagination.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p10">Then there is Christian poetry. Little of this has survived, the most significant work being the Odes of Solomon.<a class="Note" id="fna_v.i-p10.2" href="#fnf_v.i-p10.2"><sup class="Note">2</sup></a> This
<span class="pb" id="v.i-Page_18"/>  <strong>{Page 18}</strong> is the first Christian hymnbook that we possess. It was almost
certainly written in Greek sometime before <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="v.i-p10.6"/>A.D.</span> 150, though
it has come down to us only in Syriac, and in a partial Coptic
version. The Odes are hymns of praise, displaying a mystical
spirit akin to that of John and Ignatius,
and free from speculative thought.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p11">Another group of early Christian writings is composed of the
stories of martyrdoms. The simple but stirring tale of Polycarp’s
suffering forms the theme of the Letter of the Church of Smyrna
to that of Philomelium. Other important accounts concern
the persecutions in Lyons and Vienne; the martyrdoms of Perpetua and Felicitas in Carthage; of Carpus, Papylus,
and Agathonice in Pergamon; and of Apollonius in Rome.<a class="Note" id="fna_v.i-p11.8" href="#fnf_v.i-p11.8"><sup class="Note">3</sup></a> There have also been preserved some official court proceedings of the
trials and executions of Christians. Notable are those of Justin,
and of the martyrs of Scili in North Africa.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p12">Finally, there are the Christian forms of Gnostic and anti-Gnostic
literature. Most of the former has perished, though excerpts in the writings of Church Fathers enable us to reconstruct the systems of the great Gnostic teachers such as Valentinus,
with some accuracy.<a class="Note" id="fna_v.i-p12.2" href="#fnf_v.i-p12.2"><sup class="Note">4</sup></a> A number of the early Fathers wrote against Gnosticism— Justin, Rhodo, Melito, Theophilus, Modestus,
and others—but their works have not survived. The five books of Irenaeus,
Refutation and Overthrow of the Pretended but False Gnosis (usually referred to as Against Heresies), are the first full-length treatise we have giving the Catholic reply to various Gnostic systems. It is, indeed, more than this, for it includes a careful exposition of the faith; and it is unfortunate that its text has been preserved only in a
Latin translation. The significance of Irenaeus cannot be over-estimated. While he is neither a penetrating nor a systematic thinker, he sums up the main lines of the Catholic development of the second century; and from him there flow the two differing streams of Western and Eastern Christianity.</p>
      <p id="v.i-p13">Such are the types of Christian writing in the first two centuries.
Almost all of it was penned by Gentiles. Practically no
Jewish Christian literature has survived. It is possible that
<span class="pb" id="v.i-Page_19"/>  <strong>{Page 19}</strong>  Clement of Rome and Hermas were Hellenistic Jews; and it is to our loss that the Memoirs of Hegesippus,
a Hellenistic Jew of the Orient, have perished. These Memoirs comprised five books and constituted a polemic against Gnosticism. They contained also some historical details of the early Palestinian
Church, of which Eusebius has preserved some fragments in his
<i>Ecclesiastical History. </i> At the end of the second century one of the main sources underlying the pseudo-Clementine literature<a class="Note" id="fna_v.i-p13.5" href="#fnf_v.i-p13.5"><sup class="Note">5</sup></a> was written; and this gives us some knowledge of Jewish
Christianity. But it is remarkable with what rapidity the Christian
faith, born in the obscure environment of Galilee, should
have become a Gentile religion, enlisting the efforts of Gentile
writers of distinction, while Jewish Christianity should have
dwindled in importance. Judaizers were, to be sure, a force
to be reckoned with in the days of Ignatius,
and from time to time we hear of them in the writings of later Church Fathers such as Epiphanius.
But they have left no significant body of literature. Separated from their countrymen by their religious convictions, and from the Holy City by the destruction under Titus,
Jewish Christians eked out a precarious and isolated existence, until, having splintered into various groups, they were almost extinct by the fifth century, though a number of their ideas survived in Islam. It was the Greek, rather than the Jew, who became the inheritor of the Christian message-a fact which should give pause to those who unduly exaggerate the importance of Hebrew above Greek thinking.</p>

      <h2 id="v.ii-p0.1">THE SETTING</h2>
      <p id="v.ii-p1">The introductions to the various documents in our volume
will provide the reader with the requisite information to appreciate
their setting and importance. It may, however, be appropriate here
to characterize briefly the main lines of the Christian
development in the second century.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p2">The expansion of Christianity in this period was rapid and
far-flung. It penetrated Mesopotamia to Edessa and Arbela
and reached as far west as the interior of Spain, and perhaps
the southern coast of Britain. Christians were to be found on
the Rhone in Gaul, and even on the Rhine. The Dalmatian
coast was beginning to be missionized. The Church was taking
root in North Africa, Cyrenaica, and interior Egypt, as well

<span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_20"/>  <strong>{Page 20}</strong> 

as consolidating and enlarging its gains in Syria, Greece, Asia
Minor, and Italy. The spread of the new faith naturally
followed the great trade routes and was centered in the cities.
Only gradually did it win the rural areas, where ancient
traditions were more stubbornly defended.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p3">Primary among the marks of the period is the rise of the
Catholic consciousness. By this phrase is meant the emergence
of a distinctly ecclesiastical point of view, evident in the
ordering of Church life. The kerygma, or “preaching,” of the New
Testament becomes the <i>regula fidei</i> of the early Fathers. Didactic and ethical interests come to the fore. The faith is more carefully prescribed and the Church more exactly organized. The
leading concern is to conserve the apostolic witness, and, while
showing its relevance to pagan modes of thought, to guard
against the extremes of Gnostic speculation and prophetic
enthusiasm.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p4">Under the single bishop who, with his council of presbyters,
rules the congregation, there is built up a closely knit
organization which will be able to withstand the concerted
persecutions of the third century. The bishop is the successor of the apostles, representing the localizing of the prophetic, teaching, and
liturgical functions of the original apostolate. He becomes the
center of the Church’s life, the living witness and guardian of
its faith. Exactly how it came about that a single bishop should
succeed to powers earlier vested in local bodies of presbyters,
is not altogether clear; though much may be explained by the
occasional settling of an apostle, prophet, or teacher of the
original missionary ministry, in some locality. What, however,
is clear is that the development was orderly, and that it was
very widespread by the time of Ignatius.
The obvious convenience of having a single administrative head, the economic necessity whereby a congregation could afford to maintain only one full-time official, the dominance of certain leading
personalities, together with the suitability of having a single
celebrant for worship—all these factors doubtless played a role in the
rise of the monepiscopate. It is, indeed, already foreshadowed
in the Pastoral Epistles, where Timothy and Titus are viewed as Paul’s
delegates, entrusted with the supervision of the presbyteries in Ephesus and Crete. The final step is taken in the communities reflected in Ignatius’
correspondence. There the bishop is the bishop of a local congregation, and the term, originally synonymous with “presbyter,” now characterizes this distinctive office.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_21"/>  <strong>{Page 21}</strong> 
      <p id="v.ii-p5">The bishop is the living center of the Christian tradition.
He is a prophetic as well as a sacramental person; and nothing
more clearly reveals the second century attitude toward the
episcopate than the description the Smyrnaeans give of their
martyred bishop, Polycarp:
he was “an apostolic and prophetic teacher” (Mart. Poly. 16:2).</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p6">With the rise of the episcopate there emerges the importance
of the great sees of Christendom, claiming apostolic foundation.
The significance of the episcopate in Irenaeus, for instance,
does not lie in a sacramental chain of ordinations, but in a
chain of authorized teachers, which reaches back to the apostles.
Of first importance among such sees is Rome, the center of
Western Christianity, whose place of eminence is due both to
its being the imperial city and to its being the city of Peter and Paul.
It is, too, Christendom in miniature, for there Christians from all lands eventually turn up. In consequence, Rome is the ideal center from which to set one’s compass of orthodoxy.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p7">The tradition of the faith, however, was incorporated in more
than living personalities. It was enshrined in a book, and expressed
in brief, formal statements suitable for baptismal confessions. The second century saw the rise of the New Testament canon and the formation of the earliest creeds. Both were partly determined by the pressure of heresy and the consequent necessity for the Church to make its message clear. But heresy was only one factor in the development. The internal needs of the Church were such that the tradition should be preserved in accepted writings and in authentic confessions.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p8">The New Testament canon has its origin in the high regard with which Christians from the first viewed the logia of the Lord and the writings of apostles. Until <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="v.ii-p8.1"/>A.D.</span> 150, however, the only Bible of Christians was the Septuagint, the Greek Old Testament. This the Church had inherited from Judaism, and at first it sufficed. The Christian message entailed the explication of the Old Testament in the light of the acts and words of the
Messiah.
What was foreshadowed in the sacred books of the Law and the Prophets had now come to pass in the
Christ.
Hence Christian preaching was founded on the Old Testament and on the living tradition of Jesus,
passed from mouth to mouth. This feeling for personal witness was very strong in the Early Church. Papias,
for instance, records his disdain for books and his preference for “the living and abiding voice.” The tradition was not something dead, but a vital reality to be discovered from living persons. Yet the corruptions to which

<span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_22"/>  <strong>{Page 22}</strong> 

oral tradition was subject soon necessitated the writing of
Christian books; and as the living witnesses to
Christ and the apostles passed away, these books took on a new significance. They came to be read in worship, and by <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="v.ii-p8.7"/>A.D.</span> 150 they had gained the authority that had once belonged exclusively to
the Old Testament.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p9">The actual formation of the canon, however, was both
determined and hastened by the Gnostic rejection of the Old
Testament. The sharp dualism of the Gnostics, who viewed the
Jewish and Christian revelations as antithetical, found its
clearest expression in Marcion,
who flourished in the middle of the second century. He contrasted the good God revealed in
Jesus Christ with the Old Testament God of retaliation and vengeance, whom he viewed as responsible for the evil in creation. In consequence, he did away with the Old Testament as the sacred book of Christians, and in its place he supplied a canon called “The Gospel and the Apostle.” The “Gospel” was a form of our present Luke;
the “Apostle” was a corpus of ten letters of Paul.
Both the Gospel and Paul he expurgated of Old Testament references, to suit his theology. The Catholic canon was doubtless framed with Marcion’s
in view, though it was not until the fourth century that there was final unanimity on which books should be included. Three of the works in
our present volume (I Clement, II Clement, and the Didache) were at one time part of the New Testament in some areas of the Church.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p10">The creed developed as a baptismal formula. The most important is the Roman symbol which underwent various revisions until the seventh century, and came finally to be known as “The Apostles’ Creed.” Its primitive form is reflected in Irenaeus, and at the end of the second century Hippolytus<a class="Note" id="fna_v.ii-p10.2" href="#fnf_v.ii-p10.2"><sup class="Note">6</sup></a> gives us the first text of the three statements to which the baptized
yielded assent on their immersion.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p11">The process whereby the faith became ordered in the episcopate,
preserved in the canon, and defined in a creed, has its
counterpart in the development of the liturgy. Throughout
the second century prayer was still extemporaneous, though set
forms and phrases had been taken over from the Jewish synagogue, and Christian prayers were gradually becoming stereotyped. We have an instance of a traditional intercessory prayer in I Clement (chs. 59 to 61), and some reflections of the

<span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_23"/>  <strong>{Page 23}</strong> 

Eucharistic prayer will be observed in Polycarp’s Martyrdom (ch.
14). The primitive prayers of the Didache survived in Alexandria,
and, indeed, turn up two centuries later in Egyptian liturgies.
But it was the structure, rather than the exact wording of the
liturgy, that was early established. The way in which the
Church should continue the action of Jesus at the Last Supper was a matter of grave importance. It was an action that was the center of the Church’s life, for by this mystery the Christian believed he was incorporated into the very humanity of
Christ (Justin, Apol. I, ch. 66).</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p12">By the turn of the first century the Eucharist was no longer
a supper meal. The ceremony of the bread and wine had been
attached to a service of lections and prayer, derived from the
synagogue. The first description we have is in Justin’s Apology
(I, chs. 65; 67). The service takes place about dawn in a private
house, and its order is as follows: lections, sermon, intercessory
prayers, kiss of peace, offering of the bread and wine, consecration
prayer, Communion. By the end of the century we have a text of the consecration prayer in Hippolytus,
though that learned Roman is careful to indicate that he is giving a
pattern, not insisting on the exact words to be followed.<a class="Note" id="fna_v.ii-p12.2" href="#fnf_v.ii-p12.2"><sup class="Note">7</sup></a></p>
      <p id="v.ii-p13">The change from a supper meal to a dawn service arose from
several factors. For one thing, slaves, who formed a significant
part of a Christian congregation, were not free to attend an
evening meal. Then again, imperial edicts had forbidden
unlicensed clubs to hold such suppers. Moreover, to Gentiles,
who dated their days from midnight, a supper on Saturday
evening would have seemed an odd way of celebrating the
day of the resurrection. Jews dated their days from sundown,
and so the primitive Christian communities (envisaged in the
liturgical section of the Didache) naturally celebrated the day
of the resurrection with a Saturday supper. For Gentiles,
however, this cannot but have seemed inappropriate.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p14">Practically all the documents in our volume refer to the
persecution of Christians, and of this a brief word may be said.
It is a disputed point whether Christians in this early period
were persecuted because of an official, imperial rescript forbidding
their existence, or whether the action taken against
them rested only on the general police powers of Roman
magistrates. In any case there was persecution; but it was
neither so incessant nor so widespread as is often imagined.
There were spasmodic outbreaks of a savage nature, as Nero’s

<span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_24"/>  <strong>{Page 24}</strong> 

action, or the condemnations of Ignatius and Polycarp,
or the sad tale of the martyrs in Lyons and Vienne. But the State
made no concerted attempt to stamp out Christianity until the
days of Decius in the middle of the third century. Yet by their attacks on the Roman gods and by their refusal to sacrifice to the imperial genius, the Christians were always liable both to popular vengeance and to criminal prosecution.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p15">Internally, the life of the Church in the second century was
disturbed by two important movements—Gnosticism and
Montanism. The former was an attempt to modernize the faith
by accommodating it to the syncretic spirit of the age. During
our period the type of Christianity that flourished in two widely
separated centers, Edessa and Alexandria, was avowedly
Gnostic; and not, indeed, until the turn of the second century
did there emerge significant Catholic minorities in those areas.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p16">Gnosticism<a class="Note" id="fna_v.ii-p16.1" href="#fnf_v.ii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">8</sup></a> is older than Christianity. It represents the fusion of Oriental and Greek ideas into various elaborate systems whose aim is to acquire “gnosis” or knowledge of the divine. Ancient mythological material is blended with philosophic and religious ideas. Sometimes the dominating interest is the philosophic one-the problem of the one and the many. At other times the religious element is primary, and salvation is sought from the insecurity and evil of the natural world. Popular magical notions and astrology also enter in; and the
vast movement of Gnosis had manifold forms throughout the Hellenistic world. Gnosis is knowledge based on revelation, but it is not intellectual knowledge. It is saving knowledge, enabling the soul to escape from the flux and change of life and to find the assurance of immortality. By the true gnosis the soul is freed from the evil prison house of the body into which it has fallen, and empowered to ascend to its original home in the spiritual world.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p17">In the Christian forms of Gnosis there are instances where the
Christian element is clearly a superficial addition to a system
already complete. But in other cases, as in those of the great
Alexandrine teachers, Basilides and Valentinus,
the Christian factor is fundamental. Yet all Gnostic systems depend upon a principle that is at variance with Christianity—the dualism
of matter and spirit. That the body was basically evil, and in
no sense the creation of a good God, was a central tenet. It

<span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_25"/>  <strong>{Page 25}</strong> 

led Gnostics to dispute the underlying message of the Old
Testament, and to contrast the creator-God with the God
revealed in
Jesus Christ. In consequence, as we have already seen, the Old Testament was rejected, and new Christian books were substituted in its place. It is interesting that not only the first New Testament canon comes from Gnostic sources, but Gnostics were the first to give New Testament passages the authority once enjoyed by the Old Testament ( Basilides),
to write a New Testament commentary ( Heracleon),
and to make a Gospel harmony ( Tatian).
This peculiar interest in a <i>New</i> Testament stems from the rejection of the Old.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p18">Other serious consequences followed from the Gnostic
disparagement of the body. The doctrine of the incarnation
was denied. Jesus only “appeared”: he did not genuinely take on human flesh. Hence these Gnostics came to be known as “Docetics” (from <i>dokeō, </i> appear); and it is against this aspect of their teaching that Ignatius’ letters are primarily aimed.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p19">In the ethical sphere the Gnostics either espoused a strict
asceticism or else indulged in antinomianism. In the one case
they argued that the soul should cut itself as loose as possible
from the material world; in the other case they contended
that, because creation was outside the sphere of the good God,
the soul’s relation to it was a matter of indifference. Both these
attitudes were challenged by the anti-Gnostic writers, such as Irenaeus; while it is against the second that the earliest Christian sermon (II Clement) is directed.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p20">At the opposite pole to Gnosticism stands the Montanist
movement of the latter half of the second century. In essence
this was an earnest attempt to recover the prophetic note in
primitive Christianity, and to challenge both the intellectualistic
tendencies in Gnosticism and the ecclesiastical trend of the
second century Church. It was a revival of the religion of
the Spirit—an ecstatic outburst, eagerly expectant of the end
of the world and rigorous in its ascetic demands. It opposed
the developing laxity in Christian morals, which went hand
in hand with the Church’s claim to forgive sins after baptism,
and the antinomianism to which some forms of Gnosticism had
led. Born in Phrygia in Asia Minor, it passed eventually to
North Africa, where it won for its cause the vehement Tertullian,
in whose writings it takes on a severely puritanical note. But its most characteristic feature was its revival of prophecy and its emphasis on the Spirit. Wrapped in ecstatic visions, Montanus and his prophetesses declared new revelations,

<span class="pb" id="v.ii-Page_26"/>  <strong>{Page 26}</strong> 

foretelling the coming of the New Jerusalem, forbidding second
marriages and second repentance, and insisting on rigorous
fasts and other ascetic practices.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p21">The Catholic opposition to Montanism rested on the conviction that
the Christian revelation was complete. Nothing new in principle could be added to the apostolic deposit of the faith. The Church, too, was cautious about ecstasies in which the prophet lost the use of his reason and identified himself with God. “I am come neither as an angel, nor as an ambassador, but as God the Father,” said Montanus.
Against such extravagant claims, the Church insisted on the sufficiency of the apostolic tradition.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p22">The ascetic tendencies in Gnosticism and Montanism affected
the ethical life of the Catholic Church. While the extremes of
both positions were renounced, an increasing veneration of
celibacy and virginity is to be observed. In both Justin and Athenagoras this is apparent; and it reaches its full expression in the development of monasticism in the fourth century.</p>
      <p id="v.ii-p23">To conclude: The dominant interest of the second century
Church was the ordering of its life and teaching. To preserve
the apostolic witness against Gnostic perversions and Montanist
extravagancies, the episcopate, the canon, and the creed were
developed. To interpret it to the Gentile mind, its affinities
with the best in pagan religious thought were utilized. To maintain
it against persecution, the martyr was willing to suffer.
Finally, to ensure the perpetuity of the faith, the Church built
up a closely knit organization which was as uncompromising
toward heresy and schism as it was toward the demands of
the State.</p>

        <i>The Letter of the Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth, Commonly Called Clement’s First Letter</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="vi.i.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p1"><span class="sc">Outside the new testament writings, the</span>
earliest Christian document we possess is an anonymous
letter of the church of Rome to the church of
Corinth. It was written about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.i-p1.2"/>A.D.</span> 96, and was so highly
esteemed in Christian antiquity that for a while it was even
reckoned as part of the canon in Egypt and Syria.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.i-p1.3" href="#fnf_vi.i.i-p1.3"><sup class="Note">9</sup></a> Very ancient
tradition ascribes the letter to a certain
Clement who, according
to the early episcopal lists, was the third bishop of Rome.
The style of the document is simple and clear, though it is
marked by some rhetorical devices, notably a fondness for
synonyms. The importance of the letter lies in the picture it
gives us of early Roman Christianity. Here we see a version
of the gospel which, while reflecting Paulinism, is more strongly
influenced by Hellenistic Judaism, and which, in several ways,
foreshadows the leading emphases of later Roman Catholicism.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.i.i-p1.6">DATE</h4>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p2">Some references in the letter itself indicate that it stems from
the period of the second generation of Christians. The Neronian
persecution of <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.i-p2.1"/>A.D.</span> 64 is already past (chs. 5; 6): the Corinthians
are viewed as an “ancient church” (ch. 47:6), and there
are in Rome those who from youth to old age have lived irreproachable Christian lives (ch. 63:3). Yet
Peter and
Paul can be described as heroes belonging to “our own generation”
(ch. 5:1); and while the apostles have passed away, there still

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.i-Page_34"/>  <strong>{Page 34}</strong> 

survive some whom they appointed as presbyters (ch. 44).
Certain calamities have again befallen the church (chs.
1:1; 7:1). These are distinguished from the Neronian persecution
(ch. 7:1), and are generally taken to refer to Domitian’s
capricious attacks on Christians. While we are not well informed about these, there is sufficient evidence to credit them.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.i-p2.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.i-p2.5"><sup class="Note">10</sup></a> A further indication that the letter belongs to the first century
is the lack of a knowledge of the canonical Gospels. All in all,
there can be little doubt that <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.i-p2.8"/>A.D.</span> 96 or 97 (the end of Domitian’s
reign or the beginning of Nerva’s)
is the correct date.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.i.i-p2.11"> THE OCCASION OF THE LETTER</h4>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p3">The occasion of the letter was a schism in the Corinthian church. The same factious spirit that
Paul had encountered there had once again provoked serious dissension. It appears that some young men had been the ringleaders of a revolt which had succeeded in deposing the ruling presbyters (chs. 3:3;
44:6). Exactly what lay behind this action is not altogether
clear. It may be that these youths, restless under the rule of
clergy considerably older than themselves and who held office for
life, sought to introduce a more flexible system into the ministry.
Following the custom of the cults, they may have wished for
annual elections and for a constant change of officers. It is
probable, however, that an even deeper issue was involved.
There are hints in the letter that the rebels claimed to have
particular spiritual gifts which (in their judgment) were not
receiving adequate recognition. They were ascetics observing
continence (ch. 38:2). They boasted of “gnosis”—secret
knowledge of the faith, that is, revealed only to the elite (ch.
48:5). Perhaps, too, they spoke with tongues, though the references
are equally open to the interpretation that they were
persuasive and powerful speakers (chs. 21:5; 57:2). These
slight indications might lead us to suppose that the strife was
between charismatics and the regular ministry. In the course of
the Church’s history those with special spiritual gifts have not
seldom felt slighted if they received insufficient recognition or
failed to be elected to office. This is the reverse of the situation
reflected in the Didache, where the visiting prophet is held in
high esteem and it is the claims of the local ministry that have
to be pressed (chs. 11:3 ff.; 13; 15:1, 2).</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vi.i.i-Page_35"/>  <strong>{Page 35}</strong> 
      <p id="vi.i.i-p4">News of the dissension seems to have reached Rome through
hearsay (ch. 47:7). It is possible that some traveling Romans
had not been accorded the usual welcome, as visitors, by the
rebellious faction, and on returning home had spread the
report. This would account for the emphasis on hospitality
(chs. 1:2; 11; 12). In any case there is no evidence that Corinth
applied to Rome for a judgment in the matter. Rome’s intervention
is to be explained from other factors.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p5">It was nothing extraordinary for leaders of one church to
send a letter of advice and warning to another congregation.
The apostolic prerogative exercised by
Paul had set a wide precedent which was followed by the author of the seven letters in the Revelation, by Ignatius,
by Polycarp,
by
Dionysius of Corinth,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.i-p5.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.i-p5.5"><sup class="Note">11</sup></a> by Serapion,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.i-p5.8" href="#fnf_vi.i.i-p5.8"><sup class="Note">12</sup></a> and by many others. Each Christian community seems to have felt a sufficient sense of responsibility for the others so that its leaders could admonish them with solicitude. In some instances, of course, the authors claimed a special right to speak. The seer of the Revelation and the martyr Ignatius are examples. But the point to bear in mind is that the local churches did not conceive of themselves as isolated and autonomous units. They were part of the wider Church, and were not unconcerned with what happened in other congregations. This is most forcibly brought home to us by the style of our document. For it is not written in the name of an individual, but of a congregation. It is very far from a papal decree, though it was doubtless written by one of the leaders of the Roman church. It makes no claim to superior authority, but, basing itself on the authority of Scripture, it tries to persuade an errant congregation to return to the right way.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p6">Furthermore, that Rome should intervene in the internal
affairs of the Corinthian church is partly to be explained by
the close relations between the two cities. Refounded as a
Roman colony in the middle of the first century, Corinth had
built up a peculiarly intimate connection in trade and culture
with the mother city. Indeed, excavations have made clear
how exactly Corinth tried to mimic Rome—in its sculpture,
architecture, organization, and even its names. Neither the
church at Rome nor that at Corinth was, it is true, Latin in
race or language. The predominant element in both congregations
was doubtless converted Hellenistic Jews. Yet these
affinities between the two cities help to explain even the

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.i-Page_36"/>  <strong>{Page 36}</strong> 

Christian connections. Corinth, moreover, by being a natural
halt on the route between Rome and the East would be in
constant touch with the imperial capital.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p7">Yet it cannot be denied that these two explanations do not
fully account for the tone of the letter. Rome very definitely
regards it as her duty to intervene (ch. 63) and sends envoys
to see that matters are put right (ch. 65). Something of her
unique place as the church of the imperial city, and the church
of
Peter and
Paul (ch. 5), must surely have been in the writer’s mind. Among the Roman clergy (as we learn from Hermas,
Vis., II, ch. 4) there seems to have been one who acted as a
sort of “foreign secretary” for the church, sending abroad
various advices and exhortations as well as gifts of charity.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.i-p7.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.i-p7.4"><sup class="Note">13</sup></a> This implies more than a casual relation with other churches;
and while this should not be pressed to vindicate much later
papal claims, it does indicate that the Roman community took
most seriously its responsibility as a sister church for the welfare
of other congregations. Here, in germ, is that exercise of
authority which was to become the papal primacy.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.i.i-p7.9">THE AUTHOR</h4>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p8">While the letter was written in the name of the church of
Rome and its subscription did not originally mention
Clement,
there can be little doubt that he was the author. The Greek manuscripts attribute it to him, and, as early as <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.i-p8.2"/>A.D.</span> 170,
Dionysius of Corinth ascribes it to him. He speaks of it as the letter “which was previously written to us through
Clement,”
and he mentions the fact it was still read publicly in the Corinthian church on Sundays ( Eusebius,
<i>Hist. eccl.</i>
IV. 23:11).</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p9">Precisely who
Clement was is not altogether clear. The earliest episcopal lists, those of Irenaeus and Hegesippus,
make him the third bishop of Rome. This tradition, however, implies
that the monepiscopate was very early established in that city,
and doubtless reads back a later situation into the more primitive period. Certainly the terms “bishop” and “presbyter” were not yet clearly distinguished in
Clement’s
time, for he uses them as synonyms or at any rate to refer to the same class of persons, the church rulers (cf. chs. 42:4; 44:4, 5; 47:6; 57:1). Exactly what the situation was in those early years we do not know. The only hint we derive is from the Roman prophet

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.i-Page_37"/>  <strong>{Page 37}</strong>  Hermas,
who in the course of his visions relates rather epigrammatically that he is bidden to write “two little books and [to] send one to
Clement and one to Grapte.
Clement must then send it to the cities abroad, for that is his duty, and Grapte shall exhort the widows and orphans” (Hermas,
Vis. II. 4:3). The date of this vision is the late first century, and it doubtless refers to our
Clement,
among whose duties was that of acting as a kind of foreign secretary for the church. That he had some of the functions later vested in the episcopate may well be true; but that he was exactly a “bishop” in the later sense is open to doubt. It must suffice to call him a leading—perhaps <i>the</i> leading—presbyter-bishop of the Roman church.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p10">More than that we do not know of
Clement.
The attempts to identify him with the
Clement mentioned in
Paul’s
Philippians (ch. 4:3),<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.i-p10.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.i-p10.4"><sup class="Note">14</sup></a> or with the family of the consul
Titus Flavius Clemens,
are only conjectures. The name is a very frequent one in this period, especially in military circles. Yet it must be conceded that the hypothesis that has been elaborated by
J. B. Lightfoot,
that
Clement was a freedman of the Flavian family, is attractive and not entirely lacking in substance. The consul
Titus Flavius Clemens was a cousin of Domitian,
and according to
Dion Cassius he was executed by the emperor on the charge of atheism. This may possibly mean that he was a Christian, since the accusation of atheism was frequently brought against the new faith. Furthermore, his wife Domitilla was exiled; and it appears that one of the oldest Roman catacombs, the <i>Coemeterium Domitillae, </i>was situated on an estate belonging to her. Slight as these indications are, they do lend support to the theory that the consul and his wife were Christians. By virtue of his position he certainly could never have been a church official; but it is not altogether unlikely that someone connected with his household and bearing his name was the author of our letter.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.i.i-p10.14">CLEMENT’S CHRISTIANITY</h4>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p11">The most striking feature of
Clement’s
letter is its blending of Old Testament and Christian themes with Hellenistic ideas and expressions. Its author is saturated in the Old Testament, citing the Septuagint with frequency and finding in the heroes of Israel the patterns of Christian conduct. He is familiar with
Pauline writings, especially with I Corinthians, which he uses

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.i-Page_38"/>  <strong>{Page 38}</strong> 

as a model for his own letter, imitating its hymn on love (chs.
49; 50) and enlarging on its teachings regarding the resurrection (ch. 24) and schism (ch. 47). But these Jewish and Christian elements often take on a Stoic dress (e.g., chs. 20; 21); and while sometimes
Clement speaks in the very tones of
Paul,
as for instance on justification by faith (ch. 32:4), his leading
convictions are somewhat different.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p12">There is a strain of moralism in his religion, which links him
on the one hand with Hellenistic Judaism and on the other
with Stoicism. Where, for
Paul, Abraham was the hero whose faith alone made him right with God, for
Clement,
he is the pattern of obedience, of hospitality, of humility, and of righteousness (chs. 10:1, 7; 17:2; 31:2). Again, while our author
is aware of the grave issue raised by the doctrine of justification
by faith, viz., that men might continue to sin that grace should
abound, the answer he gives to this dilemma is very different
from
Paul’s.
Where the latter in Rom., ch. 6, emphasizes the mystical dying of the Christian to sin,
Clement stresses the moral imitation by the Christian of the Creator’s good works (ch. 33). Once again, in defending the doctrine of the resurrection,
Clement,
like
Paul,
can base his case on a natural theology (ch. 24.; cf. <a class="scripRef" id="vi.i.i-p12.8">I Cor. 15:36</a>), and is well aware that Christ is the first fruits of those that slept (ch. 24:1; cf. <a class="scripRef" id="vi.i.i-p12.9">I Cor. 15:20</a>). Yet his crowning argument is not the victory won by Christ over sin and the law, but the incredible tale of the phoenix (ch. 25)! Finally, where
Paul reaches to the very heart of the issue of schism by asking the incisive question, “Is Christ divided?”
Clement expatiates on the orderliness of nature (ch. 20) and the consequences of envy and rivalry (chs. 4 to 6).</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p13">These instances must suffice to indicate the extent to which
Clement has moved away from the Pauline gospel into an atmosphere more concerned with the moral life, and in particular with the virtues of humility and order. Where ethical injunctions are secondary to Paul’s letters, they are primary in
Clement.
We observe, too, a tendency, very evident in chs. 20; 24 to 25, to emphasize natural theology. All these are marks of that later Romanism to which Clement’s Letter points.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p14">It is, however, in the treatment of church order that
Clement most clearly foreshadows later Catholicism. The deposition of
the local Corinthian rulers leads him to set forth a hierarchical
view of the ministry and to stress the need of submission to the
duly elected clergy. It is claimed (chs. 42 to 44) that the
apostles appointed their first converts as presbyter-bishops

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.i-Page_39"/>  <strong>{Page 39}</strong> and provided for a future ministry should these eventually
die. It is not entirely clear how the new clergy were to be
installed, save that the congregation was to elect them. It is
possible that they were to be ordained by the remaining presbyter-bishops, though it is more likely that
Clement intends something different, viz., that they were to be ordained by a
special class of ministers who succeeded to the apostolic
prerogatives (see note on ch. 44). Here we have in essence the
doctrine of apostolic succession. Emphasis, moreover, is laid
upon the liturgical functions of these presbyter-bishops who
stand in the apostolic line. It is they who lead worship and have
the right to “offer the gifts” (ch. 44:4), just as the duly
appointed priests of the Old Testament performed the various
sacrifices (chs. 42 to 44). The sacrificial understanding of the
Lord’s Supper here comes to the fore and is clearly connected
with the theme of apostolic succession.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p15">It has been already observed that
Clement still uses the terms “presbyter” and “bishop” for the same class of persons, the church rulers, and we are not therefore to suppose that the monepiscopate has been fully established. The local church
seems to be governed by a board of presbyter-bishops, though
one of its number may have had special powers and privileges.
What, however, is important to note is that the main lines of
the later development are so plainly prefigured.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.i.i-p15.2">CONCLUSION</h4>
      <p id="vi.i.i-p16">To summarize: Clement’s Letter reflects the movement away
from the Pauline faith to a type of Christianity in which ethical
interests and concern for law and order predominate. This
does not, however, exclude both acquaintance with, and some
grasp of, the Pauline gospel. The cleavage is not so sharp as is
sometimes made out. Nor do the Stoic expressions to be found
in
Clement or his interest in, and familiarity with, the pagan world (note chs. 37 and 55:1), indicate that he has capitulated to an alien culture. Rather must we say that Roman Christianity is giving evidence of its background in Hellenistic Judaism, and adapting itself to the imperial capital.</p>

      <p id="vi.i.ii-p1">Despite the fact that Clement’s Letter was widely read in
Christian antiquity, and at one time formed part of the New

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.ii-Page_40"/>  <strong>{Page 40}</strong> 

Testament canon in Egypt and Syria, its text was unknown in
the West through the Middle Ages. Not until 1628, when the
fifth century Codex Alexandrinus reached England, was it
recovered. This Codex of the Bible was the gift of
Cyril Lucar,
the Patriarch of Constantinople, to
Charles I.
At the end of the New Testament two epistles of
Clement are appended. The first is our document; the second is not an epistle at all but a second century homily, wrongly attributed to
Clement.
Patrick Young (Junius) edited the first edition of Clement’s Letter from this Codex in 1633. This text, unfortunately defective in one page (chs. 57:7 to 63:4 being wanting), was the only one known until the discovery of the eleventh century Jerusalem Codex by
Philotheos Byrennios,
which he published in 1875. An autotype of the latter manuscript is given by
J. B. Lightfoot in his <i>Apostolic Fathers, </i>Part <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.ii-p1.8"/>I</span>, Vol. I, pp. 425–474.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.ii-p2">There are four other witnesses to the text. There is a Syriac
version, extant in one twelfth century manuscript, now in
Cambridge. It was published by
R. H. Kennett (from
Professor Bensley’s
work) in 1899. There is a Latin version, edited by
Dom G. Morin in <i>Anecdota Maredsolana, </i>Vol. II, 1894. The manuscript belongs to the eleventh century, but the translation is very ancient, going back to the second or third century. There are finally two Coptic versions independent of each other and in the Akhmimic dialect. The better preserved of the two is a Berlin papyrus of the fourth century, edited by
C. Schmidt in Texte und Untersuchungen, XXXII. 1, 1908. Chapters 34:6 to 42:2 are lacking. The other and more fragmentary one is from a Strassburg manuscript of the fifth century, edited by
F. Rösch in 1910, <i>Bruchstücke des I Klemensbriefes. </i> It breaks off at ch. 26:2.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.ii-p3">The best modern edition of the Greek text, and the one used
for this translation, is that by
Karl Bihlmeyer in his revision of
F. X. Funk’s
<i>Die apostolischen Väter, </i>Part <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.ii-p3.3"/>I</span>, Tübingen, 1924. The editions of
J. B. Lightfoot,
<i>The Apostolic Fathers, </i>Part <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.i.ii-p3.5"/>I</span>, “S. Clement of Rome,” revised edition, London, 1890, and of
Kirsopp Lake,
<i>The Apostolic Fathers </i> (Loeb Classics), London, 1912, should also be consulted. The text by
H. Hemmer in Hemmer and Lejay, <i>Les Pères apostoliques, </i>
Part 2, Paris, 1909, is based on
Funk,
<i>Patres apostolici</i> of 1901.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.ii-p4">There are a number of important modern translations. As
well as the renderings by
Lightfoot and
Lake in the works just mentioned, there are two excellent idiomatic ones: by
J. A. Kleist,

W. K. Lowther Clarke,
<i>The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, </i> S.P.C.K., London, 1937. The most recent translation is by
Edgar Goodspeed in his <i>The Apostolic Fathers: An American Translation, </i>Harper &amp; Brothers, New York, 1950.</p>

      <p id="vi.i.ii-p8">All these editions have introductions and notes. The most
illuminating are those by
Lightfoot,
Kleist,
Lowther Clarke,
Harnack, and
Hemmer.
Knopf is especially good on the lexicographical side and on parallel literature. For clarity, incisiveness, and penetration,
Harnack’s
work, despite its brevity, is unsurpassed. Written some half a century after he first published an edition of Clement, it represents the fruit of a lifetime of patristic scholarship. Many of his points are reproduced in English dress by
Lowther Clarke.</p>

Abundant grace and peace be yours from God Almighty through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p5"><b>1</b> Due, dear friends, to the sudden and successive misfortunes
and accidents we have encountered,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p5.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">16</sup></a> we have, we admit, been rather long in turning our attention to your quarrels. We refer to the abominable and unholy schism, so alien and foreign to those whom God has chosen, which a few impetuous and headstrong fellows have fanned to such a pitch of insanity
that your good name, once so famous and dear to us all, has
fallen into the gravest ill repute.  <sup>2</sup>Has anyone, indeed, stayed
with you without attesting the excellence and firmness of your
faith? without admiring your sensible and considerate Christian
piety? without broadcasting your spirit of unbounded hospitality?<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p5.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p5.4"><sup class="Note">17</sup></a> without praising your perfect and trustworthy knowledge?
 <sup>3</sup>For you always acted without partiality and walked in
God’s laws. You obeyed your rulers and gave your elders the
proper respect. You disciplined the minds of your young people
in moderation and dignity. You instructed your women to do
everything with a blameless and pure conscience, and to give
<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_44"/>  <strong>{Page 44}</strong> their husbands the affection they should. You taught them, too,
to abide by the rule of obedience and to run their homes with
dignity and thorough discretion.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p6"><b>2</b>You were all humble and without any pretensions, obeying
orders rather than issuing them, more gladly giving than
receiving.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p6.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">18</sup></a> Content with Christ’s rations and mindful of them, you stored his words carefully up in your hearts and held his sufferings before your eyes.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p7"> <sup>2</sup>In consequence, you were all granted a profound and rich
peace and an insatiable longing to do good, while the Holy
Spirit was abundantly poured out on you all.
 <sup>3</sup>You were full of
holy counsels, and, with zeal for the good and devout confidence, you stretched out your hands<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p7.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p7.1"><sup class="Note">19</sup></a> to almighty God, beseeching him to have mercy should you involuntarily have fallen into any sin.
 <sup>4</sup>Day and night you labored for the whole
brotherhood, that by your pity and sympathy the sum of his elect might be saved.
 <sup>5</sup>You were sincere and guileless and bore no grudges.
 <sup>6</sup>All sedition and schism were an abomination to
you. You wept for the faults of your neighbors, while you reckoned their shortcomings as your own.
 <sup>7</sup>You never regretted all
the good you did, being “ready for any good deed.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p7.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p7.2"><sup class="Note">20</sup></a> Possessed of an excellent and devout character, you did everything in His fear. The commands and decrees of the Lord were engraven
on the tablets of your heart.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p7.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p7.4"><sup class="Note">21</sup></a>
 <b>3</b>You were granted great popularity and growing numbers, so that the word of Scripture was fulfilled: “My beloved ate and drank and filled out and grew fat and started to kick.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p7.6" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p7.6"><sup class="Note">22</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p8"><sup>2</sup> From this there arose rivalry and envy, strife and sedition,
persecution and anarchy, war and captivity.  <sup>3</sup>And so “the
dishonored” rose up “against those who were held in honor,”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p8.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p8.1"><sup class="Note">23</sup></a> those of no reputation against the notable, the stupid against

 <sup>4</sup>For this reason righteousness and peace are far from you, since each has abandoned the fear of God and grown purblind in his faith,
and ceased to walk by the rules of his precepts or to behave
in a way worthy of Christ. Rather does each follow the lusts

while Abel made his offering from the first-born of the sheep
and of their fat. <sup>2</sup>And God looked with favor on Abel and on
his gifts; but he did not heed Cain and his sacrifices. <sup>3</sup>And Cain
was greatly upset and his face fell. <sup>4</sup>And God said to Cain,
‘Why are you so upset, and why has your face fallen? If you
have made a correct offering but not divided it correctly, have
you not sinned?<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p9.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p9.1"><sup class="Note">27</sup></a>

and you shall rule over him.’<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p9.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p9.2"><sup class="Note">28</sup></a>

holy rule of our tradition.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p13.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p13.1"><sup class="Note">39</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>Let us note what is good, what is pleasing
and acceptable to Him who made us.  <sup>4</sup>Let us fix our
eyes on the blood of Christ and let us realize how precious
it is to his Father, since it was poured out for our salvation
and brought the grace of repentance to the whole world.  <sup>5</sup>Let
us go through all the generations and observe that from one generation to another the Master
“has afforded and opportunity of repentance”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p13.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p13.2"><sup class="Note">40</sup></a> to those who are willing to turn to
him.  <sup>6</sup>Noah preached repentance and those who heeded him were saved.
 <sup>7</sup>Jonah preached destruction to the Ninevites; and when they had repented of their sins,
they propitiated God with their prayers and gained salvation despite the fact they were not God’s people.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p14"><b>8</b> The ministers of God’s grace spoke about repentance through the Holy Spirit,
 <sup>2</sup>and the Master of the universe himself spoke of repentance with an oath:
“For as I live, says the Lord, I do not desire the death of the sinner, but his repentance.”
 <sup>3</sup>He added, too, this generous consideration: “Repent, O house
of Israel, of your iniquity. Say to the sons of my people, Should your sins reach from earth to heaven, and
be redder than scarlet and blacker than sackcloth, and should you turn to me
with your whole heart and say ‘Father!’ I will heed you as though you were a holy
people.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p14.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">41</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>And in another place this
is what he says: “Wash and become clean: rid your souls of wickedness before my eyes. Cease from
your wickedness, learn to behave well, devote yourselves to justice, rescue the wronged,
uphold the rights of the orphan and grant the widow justice. And come, let us reason together,
says the Lord; and if your sins are like purple, I will make them white as snow, and if
they are like scarlet, I will make them white as wool. And if you are willing and heed me, you shall
eat the good things of the earth. But if you are unwilling and do not heed me, the sword shall devour
you. For it is the mouth of the Lord that has spoken thus.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p14.3" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p14.3"><sup class="Note">42</sup></a>
 <sup>5</sup>Since, there, he wanted all those he loved to have an opportunity to repent, he confirmed
this by his almighty will.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_48"/>  <strong>{Page 48}</strong> 
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p15"><b>9</b> So, then, let us fall in with his magnificent and glorious intention, and let us prostrate
ourselves before him as suppliants of his mercy and kindness. Let us turn to his compassion and give up
useless ventures and strife, and rivalry that leads to death.
 <sup>2</sup>Let us father our eyes on those who have served his magnificent glory to perfection.
 <sup>3</sup>Let us take Enoch, for instance, who, because he proved upright by his obedience, was translated and never died.
 <sup>4</sup>Noah proved faithful in his ministry and preached a new birth to the world. Through him, therefore,
the Master saved those living creatures that entered peacefully into the ark.  <b>10</b> Abraham, who was called
“The Friend,” proved faithful in obeying God’s words.
 <sup>2</sup>It was obedience which led him to quit his country, his kindred, and his father’s house,
so that by leaving a paltry country, a mean kindred, and an insignificant house, he might inherit God’s promises.
 <sup>3</sup>For he told him: “Depart from your country and from your kindred and from the house
of your father, and go to a land which I will show you. And I will make you great among the nations and
I will bless you and I will make your name great and you will be blessed. And I will bless those who bless you
and curse those who curse you, and all the tribes of the earth will be blessed through you.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p15.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p15.1"><sup class="Note">43</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>And again, when he separated from Lot, God told him: “Lift up your eyes and from where you
now are look to the North, the South, the East, and the West, for all the land that you see I will give
you and your seed forever.
 <sup>5</sup>And I will make your seed like the dust of the earth. If anybody can count the dust
of the earth, then your seed will be counted.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p15.3" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p15.3"><sup class="Note">44</sup></a>
 <sup>6</sup>And again he says: “God led Abraham out and told him: Look up to heaven and count
the stars, if you can. That is how numerous your seed will be! And Abraham believed God and this was put
down to his credit as an upright deed.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p15.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p15.5"><sup class="Note">45</sup></a>
 <sup>7</sup>Because of his faith and hospitality a son was granted to him in his old age,
and he obediently offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of the hills which he indicated.
 <b>11</b> Because of his hospitality and religious devotion, Lot was saved from Sodom, when
the whole countryside was condemned to fire and brimstone. In that way the Master made it clear that he
does not forsake those who put their hope on him, but delivers to punishment and torment those who turn
away from him.  <sup>2</sup>Of this latter, to be sure, his wife became and example. After
quitting the city with him, she changed her mind and fell out

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_49"/>  <strong>{Page 49}</strong> with him, with the result that she became a pillar of salt that
exists to this day. In this way it was made evident to all that
the double-minded and those who question God’s power are
condemned and become a warning to all generations.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p16"><b>12</b> Because of her faith and hospitality Rahab the harlot was saved.
 <sup>2</sup>For when the spies were sent to Jericho by Joshua the son of Nun, the king of the land got to know that they had
come to spy on his country. Consequently he sent out men to
capture them, intending to arrest them and put them to death.
 <sup>3</sup>The hospitable Rahab,
however, took them in and hid them in a room upstairs under stalks of flax.
 <sup>4</sup>When the king’s men learned of it, they said to her: “The men who are spying on
our country went into your house. Bring them out, for this is
the king’s command.” But she at once answered, “The men
you seek came into my house, but they immediately departed
and are on their way,” and she pointed in the opposite direction.
 <sup>5</sup>And she said to the men: “I am absolutely certain that the Lord God is handing this country over to you; for fear and
terror of you have fallen on all its people. When, therefore, you
come to take it, rescue me and my father’s house.”
 <sup>6</sup>And they said to her: “It shall be exactly as you say. When you learn of
our approach, you shall gather together all your family under
your roof and they shall be saved. But whoever is found outside
the house will perish.”
 <sup>7</sup>And in addition they gave her a sign that she should hang a piece of scarlet from her house. By this
they made it clear that it was by the blood of the Lord that
redemption was going to come to all who believe in God and
hope on him.
 <sup>8</sup>You see, dear friends, that not only faith but prophecy as well is exemplified in this woman.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p17"><b>13</b> Let us then, brothers, be humble and be rid of all pretensions and arrogance and silliness and anger. Let us act as Scripture bids us, for the Holy Spirit says: “Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man of his might or the rich man
of his wealth. But let him that boasts boast of the Lord; and
so he will seek Him out and act justly and uprightly.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p17.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p17.1"><sup class="Note">46</sup></a> Especially let us recall the words of the Lord Jesus, which he
uttered to teach considerateness and patience.
 <sup>2</sup>For this is what he said: “Show mercy, that you may be shown mercy. Forgive,
that you may be forgiven. As you behave to others, so they will
behave to you. As you give, so will you get. As you judge, so
you will be judged. As you show kindness, so will you receive
kindness. The measure you give will be the measure you

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_50"/>  <strong>{Page 50}</strong> get.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p17.6" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p17.6"><sup class="Note">47</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>Let us firmly hold on to this commandment and these injunctions so that in our conduct
we may obey his holy words and be humble.
 <sup>4</sup>For Holy Scripture says, “On whom shall I look except on him who is humble and
gentle and who trembles at my words?”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p17.11" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p17.11"><sup class="Note">48</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p18"><b>14</b> It is right, then, and holy, brothers, that we should obey God rather than follow those
arrogant and disorderly fellows who take the lead in stirring up loathsome rivalry.
 <sup>2</sup>For we shall incur no ordinary harm, but rather great danger, if we recklessly give
ourselves over to the designs of men who launch out into strife and sedition to alienate us from what is right.
 <sup>3</sup>Let us be kind to one another in line with the compassion and tenderness of him who created us.
 <sup>4</sup>For it is written: “The kind shall inhabit the land, and the innocent shall be left upon
it. But those who transgress shall be destroyed from off it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p18.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p18.1"><sup class="Note">49</sup></a>
 <sup>5</sup>And again he says: “I saw an ungodly man exalted and elevated like the cedars of
Lebanon. But I passed by and, look, he had vanished! And I searched for his place and could not find it.
Maintain innocence and have an eye for uprightness, for a man of peace will have descendants.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p18.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p18.4"><sup class="Note">50</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p19"><b>15</b> Let us, then, attach ourselves to those who are religiously devoted to peace, and not to
those who wish for it hypocritically.
 <sup>2</sup>For somewhere it is said, “This people honors me with its lips, but its heart is
far removed from me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p19.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p19.1"><sup class="Note">51</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>And again, “They blessed with their mouth, but they cursed with their heart.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p19.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p19.4"><sup class="Note">52</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>And again it says: “They loved him with their mouth, but they lied to him with their
tongue. Their heart was not straightforward with him, and they were not faithful to his covenant.
 <sup>5</sup>Therefore let the deceitful lips that speak evil against the righteous be struck dumb.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p19.7" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p19.7"><sup class="Note">53</sup></a>
And again: “May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips and the tongue that boasts unduly and
those who say, ‘We will boast of our tongues; our lips are our own; who is Lord over us?’
 <sup>6</sup>Because of the wretchedness of the poor and the groans of the needy I will now arise,
says the Lord. I will place him in safety: I will act boldly in his cause.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p19.9" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p19.9"><sup class="Note">54</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p20"><b>16</b> It is to the humble that Christ belongs, not to those who exalt themselves above his flock.
 <sup>2</sup>The scepter of God’s majesty, the
<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_51"/>  <strong>{Page 51}</strong> Lord Jesus Christ, did not come with the pomp of pride or
arrogance, though he could have done so. But he came in
humility just as the Holy Spirit said of him.
 <sup>3</sup>For Scripture reads: “Lord, who has believed what we heard? And to whom
has the arm of the Lord been revealed? Before him we
announced that he was like a child, like a root in thirsty ground.
He has no comeliness or glory. We saw him, and he had
neither comeliness nor beauty. But his appearance was ignominious, deficient when compared to man’s stature. He was a
man marred by stripes and toil, and experienced in enduring
weakness. Because his face was turned away, he was dishonored
and disregarded.
 <sup>4</sup>He it is who bears our sins and suffers pain for us. And we regarded him as subject to toil and stripes and
affliction.
 <sup>5</sup>But it was for our sins that he was wounded and for our transgressions that he suffered. To bring us peace he was
punished: by his stripes we were healed.
 <sup>6</sup>Like sheep we have all gone astray: each one went astray in his own way.
 <sup>7</sup>And the Lord delivered him up for our sins; and he does not open
his mouth because he is abused. Like a sheep he is led off to
be slaughtered; and just as a lamb before its shearers is dumb,
so he does not open his mouth. In his humiliation his condemnation ended.
 <sup>8</sup>Who shall tell about his posterity? For his life was taken away from the earth.
 <sup>9</sup>Because of the transgressions of my people he came to his death.
 <sup>10</sup>And I will give the wicked as an offering for his burial and the rich for his death. For he did
no iniquity and no deceit was found in his mouth. And the
Lord’s will is to cleanse him of his stripes.
 <sup>11</sup>If you make an offering for sin, your soul will see a long-lived posterity.
 <sup>12</sup>And the Lord’s will is to do away with the toil of his soul, to show him
light and to form him with understanding, to justify an upright
man who serves many well. And he himself will bear their sins.
 <sup>13</sup>For this reason he shall have many heirs and he shall share the spoils of the strong, because his life was delivered up to death
and he was reckoned among transgressors.
 <sup>14</sup>And he it was who bore the sins of many and was delivered up because of their
sins.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p20.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p20.1"><sup class="Note">55</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p21"><sup>15</sup>And again he himself says: “I am a worm and not a man, a disgrace to mankind and despised by the people.
 <sup>16</sup>All those who saw me mocked me, they made mouths at me and shook their
heads, saying: ‘He hoped on the Lord. Let him rescue him, let
him save him, since he is pleased with him!’<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p21.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p21.1"><sup class="Note">56</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p22"><sup>17</sup>You see, dear friends, the kind of example we have been

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_52"/>  <strong>{Page 52}</strong> given. And so, if the Lord humbled himself in this way, what
should we do who through him have come under the yoke of his grace?
 <b>17</b> Let us be imitators even of those who wandered
around “in the skins of goats and sheep,”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p22.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p22.1"><sup class="Note">57</sup></a> and preached the coming of the Christ. We refer to the prophets Elijah and Elisha—
yes, and Ezekiel, too—and to the heroes of old as well.
 <sup>2</sup>Abraham was widely renowned and called the Friend of God. When he gazed on God’s glory, he declared in his humility, “I am only dust and ashes.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p22.7" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p22.7"><sup class="Note">58</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>This is what is written about Job:
“Job was an upright and innocent man, sincere, devout, and one who avoided all evil.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p22.10" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p22.10"><sup class="Note">59</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>But he was his own accuser when he said, “There is none who is free from stain, not even if his life lasts but a single day.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p22.12" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p22.12"><sup class="Note">60</sup></a>

Yet even he, despite the great glory he was given, did not boast; but when he was granted an oracle from the bush, said: “Who am I that you send me? I have a feeble voice and a slow tongue.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p22.18" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p22.18"><sup class="Note">62</sup></a>

      <p id="vi.i.iii-p23"><b>18 </b>And what shall we say of the famous David?
God said of him, “I have discovered a man after my own heart, David the son of Jesse:
I have anointed him with eternal mercy.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p23.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p23.4"><sup class="Note">64</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>But he too says to God: “Have mercy upon me, O God,
according to your great mercy; and according to the wealth of your compassion wipe out my transgression.
 <sup>3</sup>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin, for
I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me.

 <sup>5</sup>The sower goes out and casts each of his seeds in the ground.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p30.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p30.1"><sup class="Note">73</sup></a> When they fall on the ground they are dry and bare, and they decay.

      <p id="vi.i.iii-p31"><b>25</b> Let us note the remarkable token which comes from the
East, from the neighborhood, that is, of Arabia.
 <sup>2</sup>There is a bird which is called a phoenix. It is the only one of its kind and lives

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_56"/>  <strong>{Page 56}</strong> five hundred years. When the time for its departure and death
draws near, it makes a burial nest for itself from frankincense,
myrrh, and other spices; and when the time is up, it gets into it and dies.
 <sup>3</sup>From its decaying flesh a worm is produced, which
is nourished by the secretions of the dead creature and grows
wings. When it is full-fledged, it takes up the burial nest containing the bones of its predecessor, and manages to carry them
all the way from Arabia to the Egyptian city called Heliopolis.
 <sup>4</sup>And in broad daylight, so that everyone can see, it lights at the altar of the sun and puts them down there, and so starts home again.
 <sup>5</sup>The priests then look up their dated records and
discover it has come after a lapse of five hundred years.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p31.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p31.1"><sup class="Note">74</sup></a>

 <b>26</b> Shall we, then, imagine that it is something great and surprising if the Creator of the universe raises up those who have served him in holiness and in the assurance born of a good faith, when he uses a mere bird to illustrate the greatness of his promise?
 <sup>2</sup>For he says somewhere: “And you shall raise me up and I shall
give you thanks”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p31.7" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p31.7"><sup class="Note">75</sup></a> and, “I lay down and slept: I rose up because you are with me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p31.9" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p31.9"><sup class="Note">76</sup></a>

      <p id="vi.i.iii-p32"><b>27</b> With this hope, then, let us attach ourselves to him who is faithful to his promises and just in his judgments.
 <sup>2</sup>He who bids us to refrain from lying is all the less likely to lie himself. For nothing is impossible to God save lying.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p32.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p32.1"><sup class="Note">78</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>Let us, then, rekindle our faith in him, and bear in mind that nothing is beyond his reach.
 <sup>4</sup>By his majestic word he established the universe, and by his word he can bring it to an end.
 <sup>5</sup>“Who shall say to him, What have you done? Or who shall resist his mighty
strength?”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p32.3" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p32.3"><sup class="Note">79</sup></a> He will do everything when he wants to and as he wants to. And not one of the things he has decreed will fail.
 <sup>6</sup>Everything is open to his sight and nothing escapes his will.
 <sup>7</sup>For “the heavens declare God’s glory and the sky proclaims
the work of his hands. Day pours forth words to day; and night
imparts knowledge to night. And there are neither words nor
speech, and their voices are not heard.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p32.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p32.5"><sup class="Note">80</sup></a></p>

By so doing we shall be sheltered by his mercy from the judgments to come.
 <sup>2</sup>For where can any of us flee to escape his mighty hand? What world is there to receive anyone who deserts him?
 <sup>3</sup>For Scripture says somewhere: “Where shall I go and where shall I hide from your presence? If I go up to heaven, you are
there. If I go off to the ends of the earth, there is your right

 <sup>4</sup>Where, then, can anyone go or where can he flee to escape from him who embraces everything?</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p34"><b>29</b> We must, then, approach him with our souls holy, lifting up pure and undefiled hands to him, loving our kind and
compassionate Father, who has made us his chosen portion.
 <sup>2</sup>For thus it is written: “When the Most High divided the nations, when he dispersed the sons of Adam, he fixed the
boundaries of the nations to suit the number of God’s angels.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p34.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p34.1"><sup class="Note">82</sup></a> The Lord’s portion became his people, Jacob: Israel was the

 <sup>3</sup>And in another place it says: “Behold, the Lord takes for himself a people from among the nations,
just as a man takes the first fruits of his threshing floor; and the

      <p id="vi.i.iii-p35"><b>30</b> Since, then, we are a holy portion, we should do everything that makes for holiness. We should flee from slandering, vile and impure embraces, drunkenness, rioting, filthy lusts, detestable adultery, and disgusting arrogance.
 <sup>2</sup>“For God,” says Scripture, “resists the arrogant, but gives grace to the
humble.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p35.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p35.1"><sup class="Note">85</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>We should attach ourselves to those to whom God’s grace has been given. We should clothe ourselves with
concord, being humble, self-controlled, far removed from all
gossiping and slandering, and justified by our deeds, not by
words.
 <sup>4</sup>For it says: “He who talks a lot will hear much in reply. Or does the prattler imagine he is right?
 <sup>5</sup>Blessed is the one his mother bore to be short-lived. Do not indulge in talking overmuch.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p35.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p35.5"><sup class="Note">86</sup></a>
 <sup>6</sup>We should leave God to praise us and not praise ourselves. For God detests self-praisers.
 <sup>7</sup>Let others applaud our good deeds, as it was with our righteous forefathers.
 <sup>8</sup>Presumption, audacity, and recklessness are traits of those accursed by
<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_58"/>  <strong>{Page 58}</strong> God. But considerateness, humility, and modesty are the traits
of those whom God has blessed.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p36"><b>31</b> Let us, then, cling to his blessing and note what leads to it.
 <sup>2</sup>Let us unfold the tale of the ancient past. Why was our father Abraham blessed? Was it not because he acted in righteousness and truth, prompted by faith?
 <sup>3</sup>Isaac, fully realizing what was going to happen, gladly let himself be led to sacrifice.
 <sup>4</sup>In humility Jacob quit his homeland because of his brother. He went to Laban and became his slave, and to him there were given the twelve scepters of the tribes of Israel.

 <b>32</b> And if anyone will candidly look into each example, he will realize the magnificence of the gifts God gives.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p37"> <sup>2</sup>For from Jacob there came all the priests and the Levites who serve at God’s altar. From him comes the Lord Jesus so far as his human nature goes. From him there come the kings and rulers and governors of Judah. Nor is the glory of the other tribes derived from him insignificant. For God promised that “your seed shall be as the stars of heaven.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p37.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p37.2"><sup class="Note">87</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>So all of them received honor and greatness, not through themselves or their own deeds or the right things they did, but through his will.
 <sup>4</sup>And we, therefore, who by his will have been called in Jesus
Christ, are not justified of ourselves or by our wisdom or insight
or religious devotion or the holy deeds we have done from the
heart, but by that faith by which almighty God has justified
all men from the very beginning. To him be glory forever and
ever. Amen.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p38"><b>33</b> What, then, brothers, ought we to do?<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p38.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p38.1"><sup class="Note">88</sup></a> Should we grow slack in doing good and give up love? May the Lord never permit this to happen at any rate to us! Rather should we be

 <sup>2</sup>For the Creator and Master of the universe himself rejoices in his works.
 <sup>3</sup>Thus by his almighty power he established
the heavens and by his inscrutable wisdom he arranged them.
He separated the land from the water surrounding it and fixed
it upon the sure foundation of his own will. By his decree he
brought into existence the living creatures which roam on it;
and after creating the sea and the creatures which inhabit it, he fixed its boundaries by his power.
 <sup>4</sup>Above all, with his holy and pure hands he formed man, his outstanding and greatest achievement, stamped with his own image.
 <sup>5</sup>For this is what God said: “Let us make man in our own image and likeness.

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_59"/>  <strong>{Page 59}</strong> And God made man: male and female he created.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p38.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p38.5"><sup class="Note">90</sup></a>
 <sup>6</sup>And so, when he had finished all this, he praised it and blessed it
and said, “Increase and multiply.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p38.7" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p38.7"><sup class="Note">91</sup></a>
 <sup>7</sup>We should observe that all the righteous have been adorned with good deeds and the very Lord adorns himself with good deeds and rejoices.
 <sup>8</sup>Since, then, we have this example, we should unhesitatingly give ourselves to his will, and put all our effort into acting uprightly.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p39"><b>34</b> The good laborer accepts the bread he has earned with his head held high; the lazy and negligent workman cannot look his employer in the face.
 <sup>2</sup>We must, then, be eager to do good; for everything comes from Him.

 <sup>5</sup>He should be the basis of our boasting and assurance. We should be subject to his will. We should
note how the whole throng of his angels stand ready to serve his will.
 <sup>6</sup>For Scripture says: “Ten thousand times ten thousand stood by him, and thousands of thousands ministered to him
and cried out: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts: all creation
is full of his glory.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p39.8" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p39.8"><sup class="Note">94</sup></a>
 <sup>7</sup>We too, then, should gather together for worship in concord and mutual trust, and earnestly beseech
him as it were with one mouth, that we may share in his great and glorious promises.
 <sup>8</sup>For he says, “Eye has not seen and ear has not heard and man’s heart has not conceived what he has
prepared for those who patiently wait for him.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p39.11" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p39.11"><sup class="Note">95</sup></a></p>

 <sup>7</sup>For Scripture says: “But God told the sinner: Why do you speak of my statutes and have my covenant on your lips?

 <sup>2</sup>Through him we fix our gaze on the heights of heaven. In him we see mirrored God’s pure and
transcendent face. Through him the eyes of our hearts have
been opened. Through him our foolish and darkened understanding springs up to the light. Through him the Master has
willed that we should taste immortal knowledge. For, “since he reflects God’s splendor, he is as superior to the angels as his

are united in a single obedience to preserve the whole body.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p43"><b>38</b> Following this out, we must preserve our Christian body too in its entirety. Each must be subject to his neighbor, according
to his special gifts.

poor; the poor must thank God for giving him someone to
meet his needs. The wise man must show his wisdom not in
words but in good deeds. The humble must not brag about his
humility; but should give others occasion to mention it. He
who is continent must not put on airs. He must recognize that
his self-control is a gift from another.
 <sup>3</sup>We must take to heart, brothers, from what stuff we were created, what kind of
creatures we were when we entered the world, from what a
dark grave he who fashioned and created us brought us into
his world. And we must realize the preparations he so generously made before we were born.

      <p id="vi.i.iii-p44"><b>39</b> Thoughtless, silly, senseless, and ignorant folk mock and jeer at us, in an effort, so they imagine, to exalt themselves.

 <sup>4</sup>What! Can a mortal be pure before the Lord? Or can a man be blameless for his actions, if
he does not believe in His servants and finds something wrong with His angels?
 <sup>5</sup>Not even heaven is pure in His sight: let alone those who live in houses of clay—of the very same clay
of which we ourselves are made. He smites them like a moth;
and they do not last from dawn to dusk. They perish, for they

performed; and required this to be done, not in a careless and disorderly way, but at the times and seasons he fixed.

win his approval and blessing. For they follow the Master’s orders and do no wrong.

 <sup>2</sup>Not everywhere, brothers, are the different sacrifices—the daily ones, the freewill offerings, and those for sins
and trespasses—offered, but only in Jerusalem. And even there
sacrifices are not made at any point, but only in front of the
sanctuary, at the altar, after the high priest and the ministers mentioned have inspected the offering for blemishes.
 <sup>3</sup>Those, therefore, who act in any way at variance with his will, suffer the penalty of death.
 <sup>4</sup>You see, brothers, the more knowledge we are given, the greater risks we run.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p47"><b>42</b> The apostles received the gospel for us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus, the Christ, was sent from God.
 <sup>2</sup>Thus Christ is from God and the apostles from Christ. In both instances the orderly procedure depends on God’s will.
 <sup>3</sup>And so the apostles, after receiving their orders and being fully convinced by the
resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and assured by God’s
word, went out in the confidence of the Holy Spirit to preach the good news that God’s Kingdom was about to come.
 <sup>4</sup>They preached in country and city, and appointed their first converts,
after testing them by the Spirit, to be the bishops and deacons of future believers.
 <sup>5</sup>Nor was this any novelty, for Scripture had
mentioned bishops and deacons long before. For this is what

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_63"/>  <strong>{Page 63}</strong> Scripture says somewhere: “I will appoint their bishops in
righteousness and their deacons in faith.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p47.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p47.1"><sup class="Note">107</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p48"><b>43 </b>And is it any wonder that those Christians whom God had entrusted with such a duty should have appointed the officers
mentioned? For the blessed Moses too, “who was a faithful servant in all God’s house,”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p48.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p48.2"><sup class="Note">108</sup></a> recorded in the sacred books all the orders given to him, and the rest of the prophets followed in his train by testifying with him to his legislation.
 <sup>2</sup>Now, when rivalry for the priesthood arose and the tribes started quarreling as to which of them should be honored with this glorious privilege, Moses bid the twelve tribal chiefs bring him rods, on each of which was written the name of one of the tribes. These he took and bound, sealing them with the rings of the tribal leaders; and he put them in the tent of testimony on God’s table.
 <sup>3</sup>Then he shut the tent and put seals on the keys just as he had on the rods.
 <sup>4</sup>And he told them: “Brothers, the tribe whose rod puts forth buds is the one God has chosen for the
priesthood and for his ministry.”
 <sup>5</sup>Early the next morning he called all Israel together, six hundred thousand strong, and
showed the seals to the tribal chiefs and opened the tent of
testimony and brought out the rods. And it was discovered that Aaron’s
rod had not only budded, but was actually bearing fruit.
 <sup>6</sup>What do you think, dear friends? Did not Moses know in advance that this was going to happen? Why certainly. But he
acted the way he did in order to forestall anarchy in Israel,
and so that the name of the true and only God might be glorified. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p49"><b>44 </b>Now our apostles, thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, knew that there was going to be strife over the title of bishop.
 <sup>2</sup>It was for this reason and because they had been given an accurate
knowledge of the future, that they appointed the officers we
have mentioned. Furthermore, they later added a codicil to
the effect that, should these die, other approved men should
succeed to their ministry.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p49.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p49.1"><sup class="Note">109</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>In the light of this, we view it as a

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_64"/>  <strong>{Page 64}</strong> breach of justice to remove from their ministry those who were appointed either by them [i.e., the apostles] or later on and with the whole church’s consent, by others of the proper standing, and who, long enjoying everybody’s approval, have ministered to Christ’s flock faultlessly, humbly, quietly, and unassumingly.
 <sup>4</sup>For we shall be guilty of no slight sin if we eject
from the episcopate men who have offered the sacrifices with innocence and holiness.
 <sup>5</sup>Happy, indeed, are those presbyters who have already passed on, and who ended a life of fruitfulness with their task complete. For they need not fear that anyone will remove them from their secure positions.
 <sup>6</sup>But you, we observe, have removed a number of people, despite their good conduct, from a ministry they have fulfilled with honor and integrity.
 <b>45</b> Your contention and rivalry, brothers, thus touches matters that bear on our salvation.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p50"><sup>2</sup>You have studied Holy Scripture, which contains the truth and is inspired by the Holy Spirit.
 <sup>3</sup>You realize that there is nothing wrong or misleading written in it. You will not find that upright people have ever been disowned by holy men.
 <sup>4</sup>The righteous, to be sure, have been persecuted, but by wicked men. They have been imprisoned, but by the godless. They have been stoned by transgressors, slain by men prompted by abominable and wicked rivalry.
 <sup>5</sup>Yet in such sufferings they bore up nobly.
 <sup>6</sup>What shall we say, brothers? Was Daniel cast
into a den of lions by those who revered God?
 <sup>7</sup>Or was Ananias, Azarias, or Mishael shut up in the fiery furnace by men devoted to the magnificent arid glorious worship of the Most High? Not for a moment! Who, then, was it that did such things? Detestable men, thoroughly and completely wicked, whose factiousness drove them to such a pitch of fury that they tormented those who resolutely served God in holiness and innocence. They failed to realize that the Most High is the champion and defender of those who worship his excellent

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_65"/>  <strong>{Page 65}</strong> name with a pure conscience. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
 <sup>8</sup>But those who held out with confidence inherited glory and honor. They were exalted, and God inscribed them on his memory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p51"><b>46</b> Brothers, <i>we</i> must follow such examples.
 <sup>2</sup>For it is written: “Follow the saints, because those who follow them will become saints.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p51.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p51.1"><sup class="Note">110</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>Again, it says in another place: “In the company of the innocent, you will be innocent; in the company of the elect, you will be elect; and in a crooked man’s company you will go wrong.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p51.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p51.2"><sup class="Note">111</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>Let us, then, follow the innocent and the upright. They, it is, who are God’s elect.
 <sup>5</sup>Why is it that you harbor strife, bad temper, dissension, schism, and quarreling?
 <sup>6</sup>Do we not have one God, one Christ, one Spirit of grace which was poured out on us? And is there not one calling in Christ?
 <sup>7</sup>Why do we rend and tear asunder Christ’s members and raise a revolt against our own body? Why do we reach such a pitch of insanity that we are oblivious of the fact we are members of each other? Recall the words of our Lord Jesus.
 <sup>8</sup>For he said: “Woe to that man! It were better for him not to have been born than to be the occasion of one of my chosen ones stumbling. It were better for him to have a millstone around his neck and to be drowned in the sea, than to pervert one of my chosen.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p51.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p51.4"><sup class="Note">112</sup></a>
 <sup>9</sup>Your schism has led many astray; it has made many despair; it has made many doubt; and it has distressed us all. Yet it goes on!</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p52"><b>47</b> Pick up the letter of the blessed apostle Paul.
 <sup>2</sup>What was the primary thing he wrote to you, “when he started preaching the gospel?”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p52.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p52.1"><sup class="Note">113</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>To be sure, under the Spirit’s guidance, he wrote to you about himself and Cephas and Apollos, because even then you had formed cliques.
 <sup>4</sup>Factiousness, however, at that time was a less serious sin, since you were partisans of notable apostles and of a man they endorsed.
 <sup>5</sup>But think now who they are who have led you astray and degraded your honorable and celebrated love of the brethren.
 <sup>6</sup>It is disgraceful, exceedingly disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian upbringing, to have it reported that because of one or two individuals the solid and ancient Corinthian Church is in revolt against its presbyters.
 <sup>7</sup>This report, moreover, has reached not only us, but those who dissent from us as well.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p52.3" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p52.3"><sup class="Note">114</sup></a> The result is that the Lord’s name is being blasphemed because of your stupidity, and you are exposing yourselves to danger.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_66"/>  <strong>{Page 66}</strong> 
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p53"><sup><b>48</b></sup>We must, then, put a speedy end to this. We must prostrate ourselves before the Master, and beseech him with tears to have mercy on us and be reconciled to us and bring us back to our honorable and holy practice of brotherly love.
 <sup>2</sup>For it is this which is the gate of righteousness, which opens the way to life, as it is written: “Open the gates of righteousness for me, so that I may enter by them and praise the Lord.
 <sup>3</sup>This is the Lord’s gate: the righteous shall enter by it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p53.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p53.1"><sup class="Note">115</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>While there are many gates open, the gate of righteousness is the Christian gate. Blessed are all those who enter by it and direct their way “in holiness and righteousness,”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p53.3" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p53.3"><sup class="Note">116</sup></a> by doing everything without disorder.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p54"><sup>5</sup>Let a man be faithful, let him be capable of uttering “knowledge,”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p54.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p54.1"><sup class="Note">117</sup></a> let him be wise in judging arguments, let him be pure in conduct.
 <sup>6</sup>But the greater he appears to be, the more humble he ought to be, and the more ready to seek the common good in preference to his own.
 <b>49</b> Whoever has Christian love must keep Christ’s commandments.
 <sup>2</sup>Who can describe the bond of God’s love?
 <sup>3</sup>Who is capable of expressing its great beauty?
 <sup>4</sup>The heights to which love leads are beyond description.
 <sup>5</sup>Love unites us to God. “Love hides a multitude of sins.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p54.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p54.2"><sup class="Note">118</sup></a> Love puts up with everything and is always patient. There is nothing vulgar about love, nothing arrogant. Love knows nothing of schism or revolt. Love does everything in harmony. By love all God’s elect were made perfect. Without love nothing can please God.
 <sup>6</sup>By love the Master accepted us. Because of the love he had for us, and in accordance with God’s will, Jesus Christ our Lord gave his blood for us, his flesh for our flesh, and his life for ours.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p55"><b>50</b> You see, brothers, how great and amazing love is, and how its perfection is beyond description.
 <sup>2</sup>Who is able to possess it save those to whom God has given the privilege? Let us, then, beg and implore him mercifully to grant us love without human bias and to make us irreproachable.
 <sup>3</sup>All the generations from Adam to our day have passed away, but those who, by the grace of God, have been made perfect in love have a place among the saints, who will appear when Christ’s Kingdom comes.
 <sup>4</sup>For it is written: “Go into your closets for a very little while, until my wrath and anger pass, and I will remember a good day and I will raise you up from your graves.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p55.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p55.1"><sup class="Note">119</sup></a>
 <sup>5</sup>Happy

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_67"/>  <strong>{Page 67}</strong> are we, dear friends, if we keep God’s commandments in the
harmony of love, so that by love our sins may be forgiven us.
 <sup>6</sup>For it is written: “Happy are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Happy is the man whose sin the Lord will not reckon, and on whose lips there is no deceit.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p55.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p55.4"><sup class="Note">120</sup></a>
 <sup>7</sup>This is the blessing which was given to those whom God chose through Jesus Christ our Lord. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p56"><b>51</b> Let us, then, ask pardon for our failings and for whatever we have done through the prompting of the adversary. And those who are the ringleaders of the revolt and dissension ought to reflect upon the common nature of our hope.
 <sup>2</sup>Those, certainly, who live in fear and love would rather suffer outrages themselves than have their neighbors do so. They prefer to endure condemnation themselves rather than bring in reproach our tradition of noble and righteous harmony.
 <sup>3</sup>It is better for a man to confess his sins than to harden his heart in the way those rebels against God’s servant Moses hardened theirs. The verdict against them was made very plain.
 <sup>4</sup>For “they went down to Hades alive,”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p56.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p56.2"><sup class="Note">121</sup></a> and “death will be their shepherd.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p56.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p56.4"><sup class="Note">122</sup></a>
 <sup>5</sup>Pharaoh and his host and all the princes of Egypt and “the chariots and their riders”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p56.6" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p56.6"><sup class="Note">123</sup></a> were engulfed in the Red Sea and perished, for no other reason than that they hardened their foolish hearts after Moses,
God’s servant, had done signs and wonders in Egypt.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p57"><b>52</b> The Master, brothers, has no need of anything. He wants nothing of anybody save that he should praise him.
 <sup>2</sup>For his favorite, David,
says: “I will praise the Lord; and this will please him more than a young calf with horns and hoofs. Let the poor observe this and rejoice.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p57.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p57.2"><sup class="Note">124</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>And again he says: “Offer to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High. Call on me in the day of your affliction and I will rescue you, and you will glorify me.
 <sup>4</sup>For the sacrifice God wants is a broken spirit.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p57.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p57.4"><sup class="Note">125</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p58"><b>53</b> You know the Holy Scriptures, dear friends—you know them well—and you have studied God’s oracles. It is to remind you of them that we write the way we do.
 <sup>2</sup>When Moses ascended the mountain and spent forty days and forty nights in fasting and humiliation, God said to him: “Get quickly down from
here, for your people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt,
have broken the law. They have quickly turned from the way

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_68"/>  <strong>{Page 68}</strong> you bid them take. They have cast idols for themselves.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p58.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p58.2"><sup class="Note">126</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>And the Lord told him: “I have spoken to you once, yes, twice, saying, I have looked at this people and, see, it is obstinate. Let me exterminate them, and I will wipe out their name from under heaven, and I will make you into a great and wonderful nation, much larger than this one.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p58.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p58.5"><sup class="Note">127</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>And Moses answered: “No, no, Lord. Pardon my people’s sin, or else eliminate me too from the roll of the living.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p58.9" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p58.9"><sup class="Note">128</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p59"><sup>5</sup>O great love! O unsurpassed perfection! The servant speaks openly to his Lord. He begs pardon for his people or requests that he too will be wiped out along with them.
 <b>54</b> Well, then, who of your number is noble, large-hearted, and full of love?  <sup>2</sup>Let him say: “If it is my fault that revolt, strife, and schism have arisen, I will leave, I will go away wherever you wish, and do what the congregation orders. Only let Christ’s flock live in peace with their appointed presbyters.”
 <sup>3</sup>The man who does this will win for himself great glory in Christ; and will be welcome everywhere. “For the earth and its fullness belong to the Lord.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p59.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p59.1"><sup class="Note">129</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>This has been the conduct and will always be the conduct of those who have no regrets that they belong to the city of God.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p60"><b>55</b> Let us take some heathen examples:<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p60.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p60.1"><sup class="Note">130</sup></a> In times of plague many kings and rulers, prompted by oracles, have given themselves up to death in order to rescue their subjects by their own blood.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p60.2" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p60.2"><sup class="Note">131</sup></a> Many have quit their own cities to put an end to sedition.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p60.4" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p60.4"><sup class="Note">132</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>We know many of our own number who have had themselves imprisoned in order to ransom others. Many have sold themselves into slavery and given the price to feed others.
 <sup>3</sup>Many women, empowered by God’s grace, have performed deeds worthy of men.
 <sup>4</sup>The blessed Judith, when her city was under siege, begged of the elders to be permitted to leave it for the enemy’s camp.
 <sup>5</sup>So she exposed herself to danger and for love of her country and of her besieged people, she departed. And the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.
 <sup>6</sup>To no less danger did Esther,
that woman of perfect faith, expose herself in order to rescue the twelve tribes of Israel when they were on the point of being destroyed. For by her fasting and humiliation she implored the all-seeing Master,

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_69"/>  <strong>{Page 69}</strong> the eternal God; and he beheld the humility of her soul and rescued her people for whose sake she had faced danger.</p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p61"><b>56</b> So we too must intercede for any who have fallen into sin, that considerateness and humility may be granted to them and that they may submit, not to us, but to God’s will. For in that way they will prove fruitful and perfect when God and the saints remember them with mercy.
 <sup>2</sup>We must accept correction, dear friends. No one should resent it. Warnings we give each other are good and thoroughly beneficial. For they bind us to God’s will.
<sup>3</sup>This is what the Holy Word says about it: “The Lord has disciplined me severely and has not given me up to death.
 <sup>4</sup>For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and punishes every son he accepts.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p61.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p61.1"><sup class="Note">133</sup></a>
 <sup>5</sup>For, it says, “the upright man will discipline me with mercy and reprove me. But let not the oil of sinners anoint my head.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p61.5" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p61.5"><sup class="Note">134</sup></a>
 <sup>6</sup>And again it says: “Happy is the man the Lord reproves. Do not refuse the Almighty’s warning. For he inflicts pain, and then makes all well again.
 <sup>7</sup>He smites, but his hands heal.
 <sup>8</sup>Six times will he rescue you from trouble; and on the seventh evil will not touch you.
 <sup>9</sup>In famine he will rescue you from death; in war he will deliver you from the edge of the sword.
 <sup>10</sup>From the scourge of the tongue he will hide you, and you will not be afraid of evils when they come.
 <sup>11</sup>You will ridicule the wicked and lawless, and not be afraid of wild beasts;
 <sup>12</sup>for wild beasts will leave you in peace.
 <sup>13</sup>Then you will discover that your house will be peaceful, and the tent in which you dwell will be safe.
 <sup>14</sup>You will find, too, that your seed will be numerous, and your children like the grass of the fields.
 <sup>15</sup>You will come to your tomb like ripe wheat harvested at the appropriate season, or like a heap on the threshing floor gathered together at the right time.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p61.7" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p61.7"><sup class="Note">135</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p62"><sup>16</sup>You see, dear friends, how well protected they are whom the Master disciplines. Yes, he is like a good Father, and disciplines us so that the outcome of his holy discipline may mean mercy for us.
 <b>57</b> And that is why you who are responsible for the revolt must submit to the presbyters. You must humble your hearts and be disciplined so that you repent.
 <sup>2</sup>You must learn obedience, and be done with your proud boasting and curb your arrogant tongues. For it is better for you to have an insignificant yet creditable place in Christ’s flock than to appear eminent and be excluded from Christ’s hope.
 <sup>3</sup>For this is what the excellent Wisdom says: “See, I will declare to you the utterance of my Spirit: I will teach you my word.
 <sup>4</sup>Since I called

<span class="pb" id="vi.i.iii-Page_70"/>  <strong>{Page 70}</strong> and you did not listen, since I poured out words and you did
not heed, but disregarded my plans and disobeyed my reproofs,
therefore I will laugh at your destruction. And I will rejoice
when ruin befalls you and when confusion suddenly overtakes
you, and catastrophe descends like a hurricane, or when persecution and siege come upon you.
 <sup>5</sup>Yes, it will be like this: when
you call upon me, I will not heed you. The wicked shall look for me and shall not find me. For they detested wisdom, and
did not choose the fear of the Lord. They had no desire to heed my counsels, and mocked at my reproofs.
 <sup>6</sup>For this reason they
shall eat the fruit of their ways and fill themselves with impiety.
 <sup>7</sup>Because they wronged babes, they will be slain; and by being
searched out the impious shall be destroyed. But he that listens
to me will dwell in confident hope and live quietly, free from
the fear of any misfortune.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.i.iii-p62.1" href="#fnf_vi.i.iii-p62.1"><sup class="Note">136</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.i.iii-p63"><b>58</b> So, then, let us obey his most holy and glorious name and
escape the threats which Wisdom has predicted against the
disobedient. In that way we shall live in peace, having our confidence in his most holy and majestic name.
 <sup>2</sup>Accept our advice, and you will never regret it. For as God lives, and as
the Lord Jesus Christ lives and the Holy Spirit (on whom the
elect believe and hope), the man who with humility and eager
considerateness and with no regrets does what God has decreed
and ordered will be enlisted and enrolled in the ranks of those
who are saved through Jesus Christ. Through him be the glory
to God forever and ever. Amen.</p>

(a) The apostles provided that, if they themselves should die, other approved men should succeed to the apostolic prerogatives. These men would take over the right to appoint the local presbyteries, and are the ones referred to by the phrase, “Others of the proper standing.”
(b) The apostles provided that should their first converts (i.e., the first local presbyters) die, others should succeed them. This succession would be in the hands of the apostles and, later on, of “others of the proper standing,” i.e., men like Timothy and Titus with apostolic rank.
(c) The apostles provided that should their first converts (i.e., the first local presbyters) die, others should succeed them. This succession, begun by the apostles, would be continued by self-perpetuating presbyteries. In this view, the phrase, “Others of the proper standing,” would refer to the same class of persons as does the phrase, “The officers we have mentioned,” in the preceding sentence, i.e., to presbyters. The reader will observe that, while the titles “presbyter” and “bishop” appear to be synonymous in Clement, the first two interpretations favor the “episcopal” view of the early ministry, while the third favors the “presbyterian.”</div>

        <i>The Letters of Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="vi.ii.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p1"><span class="sc">The significance of these seven letters lies in</span>
their being intimate, familiar, and popular. They do not, in the
first instance, reveal a set of ideas though they are not lacking in thoughtfulness. Rather do they reveal a man. So much of early Christian literature is impersonal that it is refreshing to stumble upon letters reminiscent of the frank and personal note of
Paul’s
correspondence.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p2">The conditions under which Ignatius’ letters were written
did not make for careful reflection. They are the letters of a
prisoner on his way to martyrdom. Their religious character
is popular rather than deep. Their style is compressed and
turbulent, reflecting the brusque and impetuous nature of
their author (Trall., ch. 4), as well as the irritation of a captive
subjected to brutality (<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p2.1">Rom. 5:1</a>).
Their metaphors change with alarming abruptness, and are often more striking than apt (Eph., ch. 9).
Their grammar is not free from carelessness. Yet for these very reasons they have a peculiar value. They disclose a real person, expressing himself in the moment of crisis, and so making clear the ruling passions of his life.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p3">Our knowledge of Ignatius is confined almost entirely to
these letters. The later acts of his martyrdom are pure romances,
resting on no historical foundations. It is only for the few days
when he journeys from Philadelphia to Troas under a military
guard that we catch a glimpse of this early second century
bishop.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p4">It appears that he was bishop of Antioch in Syria,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.i-p4.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.i-p4.1"><sup class="Note">162</sup></a> and

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.i-Page_75"/>  <strong>{Page 75}</strong> 

during a short but intense persecution of that city had been
condemned to fight with wild beasts in Rome. Perhaps others
had suffered the same fate, but this is not altogether clear unless
we so interpret the reference in Rom., ch. 10.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.i-p4.7" href="#fnf_vi.ii.i-p4.7"><sup class="Note">163</sup></a> In any case,
chained to a squad of soldiers, he is taken by the overland route
through Cilicia and Asia Minor, and thence to Rome. Where
the way forks at Laodicea, the northern road is chosen. He
halts at Philadelphia, and then again at Smyrna, where he is
welcomed by Polycarp, the bishop of that city, and by delegates
from the neighboring churches of Ephesus, Magnesia, and
Tralles. It is from Smyrna too that he writes the first four of his
letters—three to the churches that had sent delegates and one
to the church at Rome. Pressing northward, he stops again at
Troas. From here he corresponds with the churches of Philadelphia and Smyrna, and adds a personal note to Polycarp.
We gather that he crossed by sea to Neapolis and halted once
more at Philippi, where the Christians welcomed him.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.i-p4.12" href="#fnf_vi.ii.i-p4.12"><sup class="Note">164</sup></a> After that he passes out of sight. We may, however, conjecture that
he reached Italy by way of Dyrrhacium and Brundisium.
Furthermore, we may be fairly sure that he was eventually
martyred in the Coliseum sometime during Trajan’s reign
(<span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.ii.i-p4.14"/><span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.ii.i-p4.15"/>A.D.</span> </span> 98–117).<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.i-p4.16" href="#fnf_vi.ii.i-p4.16"><sup class="Note">165</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p5">Ignatius’ letters are dominated by three concerns. First
is his approaching martyrdom. To “imitate the Passion of my
God”
(<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p5.1">Rom. 6:3</a>) is the exclusive theme of the letter to the Romans, but it underlies the others as well. This, for him, is the way to become a “real disciple,” a “genuine Christian.” He is
clearly impatient to “get to God”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.i-p5.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.i-p5.2"><sup class="Note">166</sup></a> by way of martyrdom; and to brace himself for the ordeal he pictures in startling detail what this must mean for him
(<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p5.4">Rom. 5:2, 3</a>). We are not, therefore, surprised that the same line of thought is reflected in
other aspects of the letters. His theology, for instance, revolves
around the blood of Christ (cf. the striking and compressed

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.i-Page_76"/>  <strong>{Page 76}</strong> thought of <a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p5.5">Eph. 1:1</a>); and he emphasizes the reality of Christ’s Passion by pointing to his own imminent death (Smyr. 4:2).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p6">The second concern is for the unity of the Church. Against
threatening schisms, Ignatius is persistent in his stress on
obedience to the Church authorities. In his letters there first
emerges the picture of the local congregation governed by a
single bishop who is supported by a council of presbyters and
assisted by deacons. In this Ignatius betrays a stage of development beyond the situation reflected in the Pastoral Epistles, the
Didache, and I Clement. There the titles “bishop” and “presbyter,” and perhaps the offices too, are not clearly distinguished. The local congregations are ruled by boards of officials
(sometimes called bishops, sometimes presbyters), subject only
to apostolic figures, such as Timothy and Titus, or to itinerant
prophets. In Ignatius, on the contrary, the single bishop is the
leading figure in the Church. Without his approval no services
are to be held (Smyr. 8:2) or other action taken (Trall. 7:2).
He seems to represent the localizing of the teaching, ruling,
and prophetic functions of the original missionary ministry of
apostles, prophets, and catechists. This process had, indeed,
already started in the Didache (see ch. 13); but in Ignatius it
is complete.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p7">What, however, is most striking about this appearance of
the monepiscopate in Ignatius is the lack of an explicit doctrine
of apostolical succession. For him the authority of the Church
officers is not derived from a chain of teaching chairs (as in Irenaeus)
or from a succession of ordinations (as in Augustine),
but from the fact that their offices are the earthly antitype of
a heavenly pattern. The bishop, for instance, represents God;
the presbyters, the apostles; and the deacons, Christ (Mag. 6:1).
Such teaching stems from a Platonic way of looking at things,
and stands in marked contrast with those views of authority
that emphasize the historical connection between the episcopate and the apostles. Rather is it a mystical nexus between
the earthly Church and the sphere of the divine, which is
fundamental in Ignatius. It is this that makes it possible for
him to urge that deference to the bishop is the same thing as
deference to God (<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p7.3">Eph. 5:3–6</a>).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p8">The bishop in Ignatius, moreover, is not only an administrative and liturgical officer. He is also a prophet. This is especially true in his own case. In Philad., ch. 7, he gives us an instance of his gifts in this direction, while the name Theophorus (“God-inspired”), which he assumes, is likely not a

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.i-Page_77"/>  <strong>{Page 77}</strong> 

proper name but an epithet to indicate his prophetic character.
One may note, similarly, how he urges Polycarp to seek for heavenly revelations (Poly. 2:2). Not inappropriately, therefore, did the Smyrnaeans remember Polycarp as “an apostolic and <i>prophetic</i> teacher” (Mart. Poly. 16:2).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p9">The third concern in Ignatius is to unmask those heretical
movements which are leading to schism. Two of these are
prevalent; and while he does not go into detail, believing as he
does more in order than in argument, we may gather their
main features from his casual references.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p10">In Philadelphia he came into personal contact with a Judaizing movement similar to the one attacked by Paul in his Letter to the Galatians and mentioned later in the Apocalypse
(<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p10.2">ch. 3:9</a>). It was, to be sure, not so thoroughgoing as that
faced by Paul,
circumcision not being demanded of its Gentile devotees (Philad. 6:1). But the observance of the Sabbath was involved, along with belief in certain Jewish traditions and allegories (Mag., chs. 8; 9).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p11">At the opposite pole to this error was the Docetic heresy, rife
in Smyrna. Here the attempt to accommodate the gospel to Greek
culture had gone to the limit of denying the reality of the Lord’s
body. The basic Hellenistic idea that matter was evil led inevitably to disbelief in the incarnation. God could not have a
direct relation with the sensible world, since this was the province of evil. Accordingly, Christ could not have been genuinely
man. He only appeared or seemed to have a body (whence
“Docetism,” from the Greek <i>dokeō, </i>

seem), being as it were a phantom from the heavenly sphere. The way Ignatius plays on this theme is interesting. By inventing a sham Christ (a Christ who only “seems” to be), the Docetics prove themselves to be a sham, and they will end up by becoming apparitions! (Trall., ch. 10; Smyr., ch. 2).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p12">Against such views Ignatius introduces two of the leading
emphases of his theology. One is the divinity of Christ. This
was compromised by the Judaizing movement, which viewed
him as the last of the prophets. For Ignatius, Christ is “our
God.” He can even speak of the “Christ God” (Smyr. 10:1), revealing by such an expression his own Christocentric faith and also something of the liberal use of the word <i>theos</i> (god) to be found in Hellenistic circles.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p13">The other emphasis of Ignatius’ Christianity falls upon the
reality of the incarnation, Passion, and resurrection of the
Christ. He continually stresses the genuine and actual nature

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.i-Page_78"/>  <strong>{Page 78}</strong> 

of these occurrences and the inseparable unity of
flesh and spirit—even after the
resurrection (Smyr., ch. 3). So much so, that
such repeated phrases as “in flesh and in spirit” become
expressions similar to our “body and soul,” and are used as
synonyms for “thoroughly” or “completely” (cf. <a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p13.1">Eph. 10:3</a>; Mag. 13:2).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p14">While these are two of the central themes of Ignatius’
thought, recent study has drawn attention to other aspects of
it. One concerns the affinities between Ignatius and the
Gnostics. There are, indeed, traces of Gnostic terminology
in the letters, and a number of ideas (as for instance those in Eph., chs. 19; 20)
which were later elaborated in the Valentinian and other systems. But Ignatius was not a Gnostic: he was
very far from it. His was not a speculative mind. Indeed, it is
the simplicity and uncompromising quality of his basic convictions, so frequently expressed in compact, credal statements,
which are most characteristic of him. That is not, however, to
deny that Ignatius is hospitable to quite a few phrases and ideas
familiar from Hellenistic religion and alien to the general
stream of Biblical thought. The Eucharist is “the medicine of
immortality” (<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p14.1">Eph. 20:2</a>);
Christians are “full of God” (Mag., ch. 14);
God is <i>Sigē</i> (silence, Mag. 8:2);
and the divine sphere is <i>Plērōma</i> (fullness, Eph., inscr.). Again, Ignatius alludes to
the myth of the New Man (<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p14.2">Eph. 20:1</a>),
and has touches of Gnostic influence in his Church mysticism, where the earthly order reflects the heavenly pattern. Yet, for all that, the central convictions of the Christian faith are clearly—even dogmatically—affirmed, while against the basic Gnostic tenet that
matter is evil he wages a constant warfare.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p15">Closely connected with this issue are others which bear upon
Ignatius’ relation to the New Testament faith. How far does he
deviate from the Pauline gospel? Is he influenced by John?
Does he depart from John? It is not needful here to review these
complex questions at length. Rather should the reader bear
them in mind as he surveys the letters. One or two points,
however, may be noted.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p16">Ignatius knew several letters of Paul —perhaps the original corpus of seven. He was most familiar with I Corinthians.
He probably knew Ephesians;
and there may be reminiscences of others. Some parts of the Pauline gospel—above all, the sense of fellowship with the crucified and risen Christ—he understood well. Others were strange to him. He never grasped Paul’s teaching on justification, on deliverance from <i>sarx</i> (flesh), or
<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.i-Page_79"/>  <strong>{Page 79}</strong> 

on the indwelling Spirit. Nor did he penetrate the fullness of Paul’s
view of faith as receptivity, the opposite of boasting. In
Ignatius faith is primarily conviction. Sometimes, indeed, he
uses Pauline phrases with meanings that widely differ from the
original (e.g.,
<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p16.5">Rom. 5:1</a>;
<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p16.6">Eph. 8:2</a>).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p17">With John the question is more difficult. There are a number
of possible reminiscences (Mag. 7:1; <a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p17.2">Rom. 7:2, 3</a>; Philad. 7:1; 9:1),
but none is decisive. All of them can be explained by a
common religious ethos. Yet their weight is cumulative, and
there is a close relation between the views of John and Ignatius on the Eucharist (cf.
<a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p17.4">John 6:54</a> with <a class="scripRef" id="vi.ii.i-p17.5">Eph. 20:2</a>, and Smyr. 7:1).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p18">In general it would be true to say that the Christianity of
Ignatius represents a step removed from the central New
Testament faith. It lacks the freshness and depth of the Pauline
and Johannine gospels, though this can easily be exaggerated.
The process by which the faith became ordered and organized,
thereby losing something of its original spontaneity and reliance
on the Spirit, is evident in the New Testament itself, especially
in the Pastoral Epistles. Ignatius carries the development a
little farther, striking out on a line of Church mysticism
somewhat different from the moral note of the Pastorals
and I Clement. But at the same time it is impossible to miss in
Ignatius the intense devotion to the person of Christ and the
consciousness of fellowship with his sufferings.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p19">“A soul seething with the divine <i>eros</i>”—such is Chrysostom’s
description of Ignatius in his eulogy delivered on the martyr’s
feast in Antioch.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.i-p19.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.i-p19.2"><sup class="Note">167</sup></a> It is an apt phrase, for more reasons than Chrysostom intended. There is a religious vehemence about
these letters, even an impatience and a heat of excitement,
which is more fittingly expressed by the classical <i>eros</i> than by
the uniquely Christian <i>agapē</i>. Ignatius is himself aware of his
lack of gentleness and calm (Trall. 4:2). He had, too, something
of those sharp alternations of pride and humility, which we meet
in Paul (Trall., chs. 4; 5). His letter to the Romans, moreover,
expresses that exaggerated passion for martyrdom which the
Church later sought to restrain. In the light of these traits it
is interesting to notice how struck Ignatius was by the bishops
of Ephesus and Philadelphia (Eph., ch. 6; Philad. 1:1). He saw
in their modest and retiring character what was most lacking in
his own. By their quietness they seemed the more effectual and,
as bishops, were the better able to mirror the divine nature
which their office represented (Eph., chs. 6; 15). God’s

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.i-Page_80"/>  <strong>{Page 80}</strong> essential character was that of silence—a silence broken only
at the incarnation, and even then with reserve and modesty (Eph., ch. 19).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.i-p20">Yet, for all this, there is a nobility about this Oriental martyr.
He can recognize his weakness, and he has grasped the central
truth of the Christian gospel, incorporating it into his very life.
He will suffer with Christ and so become a genuine disciple.</p>

Ignatius calls himself “the bishop of Syria,” but this doubtless means no more than “the bishop from Syria,” “the Syrian bishop.” The phrase has no connection with the much later organization of dioceses.

      <h3 id="vi.ii.ii-p0.1">MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS</h3>
      <h4 id="vi.ii.ii-p0.2">THE MANUSCRIPTS OF IGNATIUS’ LETTERS</h4>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p1">The letters of Ignatius were first collected by Polycarp,
the bishop of Smyrna,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.ii-p1.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.ii-p1.2"><sup class="Note">168</sup></a> who sent copies of them to the church at Philippi not long after Ignatius had left that city on his way across Macedonia (Phil., ch. 13). Whether this collection contained all seven letters is not clear. Possibly Polycarp did not have access to the one to the Romans, though this was early in circulation, being quoted by Irenaeus (<i>Adv. haer.</i> V. 28:4), and known, of course, to Eusebius.
It is likely that copies of all the letters were kept by Ignatius’ amanuensis, the Ephesian Burrhus (see Philad. 11:2), and that Polycarp obtained them from him.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p2">We possess no pure manuscript of the original corpus, for in
the fourth century the letters were interpolated and six additional ones added
(Mary of Cassobola
to Ignatius; Ignatius to
Mary,
to the Tarsians, Philippians, Antiochenes, and to
Hero, deacon of Antioch). The aim of these forgeries was to gain for
a diluted form of Arianism the authority of a primitive martyr.
Finally, in the Middle Ages—perhaps around the twelfth
century, which saw a new development of the cult of the
Virgin—a correspondence between Ignatius and
Mary,
as well as two letters of Ignatius to
John, was fabricated in the
West.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p3">The greater part of the extant manuscripts contains the seven
interpolated letters along with five or six of the spurious ones,

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.ii-Page_82"/>  <strong>{Page 82}</strong> 

some of the Latin versions adding the medieval forgeries. The
first edition of the Latin was by
J. Faber Stapulensis (Lefèvre d’Étaples), Paris, 1498, and of the Greek by
Valentinus Paceas,
Dillingae, 1557.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p4">With the revival of learning in the Renaissance a critical
spirit toward the Ignatian corpus first arose; but it was not until
the labors of
Theodor Zahn and
J. B. Lightfoot in the nineteenth century that the question was finally settled and the
genuine form of the letters of Ignatius was fully established.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p5">A pioneer work which attempted to separate the wheat from
the chaff was that of the Genevan professor
Nicholaus Vedelius in 1623. He printed the seven letters known to Eusebius by themselves, relegating the six spurious ones to a separate
volume. He recognized, too, that even the seven genuine ones
had been interpolated. It was, however,
Archbishop James Ussher who in the seventeenth century first discovered the pure text of the letters, though in a Latin version. The controversy
with the Puritans over episcopacy brought the question of the
genuineness of Ignatius’ correspondence into the foreground;
and, in his efforts to defend this, Ussher came upon two Latin
manuscripts that contained versions of the text corresponding
to that known to Eusebius and other fathers. These manuscripts
did, indeed, contain five of the forged letters as well; but the
remarkable thing was that the text of the genuine seven had
not been interpolated. Ussher published his text in 1644, and
his guess that
Robert Grosseteste (the learned medieval
bishop of Lincoln) had been the translator has since been
confirmed.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p6">Two years later (1646)
Isaac Voss in Amsterdam published
the Greek text of this Latin version from an eleventh century
Florentine manuscript. In this the letter to the Romans is wanting, the manuscript being defective and breaking off in the
middle of the Epistle to the Tarsians. But as it was customary
to separate Romans from the others and to embed it in the
Acts of Ignatius’ Martyrdom, it was doubtless in the original
manuscript. These Acts would have come at the end, as they
do in Ussher’s Latin versions. Anyway, the defect was supplied
by the discovery of a tenth century Greek manuscript of the
Martyrology, published by T. Ruinart in 1689.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p7">The authenticity of the text defended by Ussher and Voss
was soon attacked by French Calvinists (notably by
Jean Daillé in Geneva, 1666); but a full and learned reply was offered by
Bishop John Pearson in his <i>Vindiciae Ignatianae</i>, 1672.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vi.ii.ii-Page_83"/>  <strong>{Page 83}</strong> 
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p8">Considerably later (1845) an English canon,
Dr. W. Cureton,
published a Syriac version of three of the letters (Polycarp,
Ephesians, and Romans). This text (based finally on three
manuscripts) was considerably more brief than the Vossian;
and in his learned work <i>Corpus Ignatianum</i> (1849)
Cureton argued that it represented the genuine form of the letters. His theory, however, did not win acceptance. The works of
Theodor Zahn (<i>Ignatius von Antiochien,</i> Gotha, 1873) and of
J. B. Lightfoot (<i>The Apostolic Fathers,</i> Part 2, Vol. I, London, 1885)
have convincingly shown that Cureton’s text represents a rather
crude abridgment of the original letters.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p9">To summarize: the letters of Ignatius have come down to
us in three forms. There is the long recension, interpolated in
the fourth century. There is the short Syriac recension, which
is an abridgment of the authentic letters. Finally there is the
middle recension, or genuine text.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p10">A full description of the manuscripts (including the Armenian, and the Syriac and Coptic fragments) will be found in Lightfoot,
<i>op. cit.,</i> pp. 70–126; 587–598. To this must be added
the fifth century Berlin papyrus fragment of <i>Smyrnaeans</i> (in Greek: see
C. Schmidt and
W. Schubert in
<i>Altchristliche Texte,</i> Berliner Klassikertexte, Heft VI, 1910),
and the Coptic fragments published by
Carl Wessely in <i>Sitzungsberichte der kais. Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien,</i> Vol. CLXXII, Part 4, 1913.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.ii.ii-p10.4">THE ACTS OF IGNATIUS’ MARTYRDOM</h4>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p11">The Acts of Ignatius’ Martyrdom are current in five forms.
Of these only two are independent, the so-called Antiochene
and Roman Acts. The others are combinations and modifications of them.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p12">The Antiochene Acts derive their name from the fact that
their center of interest is Antioch, where Ignatius is tried by Trajan and whither his bones are brought back from Rome. These Acts date from the fifth century and rest on no historical foundation. Their textual history, however, is important, since the genuine text of Ignatius’ Letter to the Romans is embedded
in them. They are current in Latin, Greek, and Syriac.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.ii-p13">Even more crudely legendary are the Roman Acts, which
belong to the sixth century and record Ignatius’ trial before Trajan and the Senate and his martyrdom in the amphitheater. They are extant in Greek and Coptic.</p>

The source of your unity and election is genuine suffering which you undergo by

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.i-Page_88"/>  <strong>{Page 88}</strong> the will of the Father and of Jesus Christ, our God. Hence you
deserve to be considered happy.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p4"><b>1</b> I gave a godly welcome to your church which has so endeared itself to us by reason of your upright nature, marked as it is by faith in Jesus Christ, our Saviour, and by love of him. You are imitators of God; and it was God’s blood that stirred you
up once more to do the sort of thing you do naturally and have now done to perfection.
 <sup>2</sup>For you were all zeal to visit me when you heard that I was being shipped as a prisoner from Syria
for the sake of our common Name<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p4.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p4.1"><sup class="Note">172</sup></a> and hope. I hope, indeed, by your prayers to have the good fortune to fight with wild beasts in Rome, so that by doing this I can be a real disciple.
 <sup>3</sup>In God’s name, therefore, I received your large congregation in the person of Onesimus,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p4.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p4.3"><sup class="Note">173</sup></a> your bishop in this world,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p4.5" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p4.5"><sup class="Note">174</sup></a> a man whose love is beyond words. My prayer is that you should love him in the spirit of Jesus Christ and all be like him. Blessed is He who let you have such a bishop. You deserved it.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p5"><b>2</b> Now about my fellow slave<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p5.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p5.1"><sup class="Note">175</sup></a> Burrhus, your godly deacon, who has been richly blessed. I very much want him to stay with me. He will thus bring honor on you and the bishop. Crocus too, who is a credit both to God and to you, and whom I received as a model of your love, altogether raised my spirits (May the Father of Jesus Christ grant him a similar comfort!), as did Onesimus, Burrhus, Euplus, and Fronto.
In them I saw and loved you all.
 <sup>2</sup>May I always be glad about you, that is, if I deserve to be! It is right, then, for you to render all glory to Jesus Christ, seeing he has glorified you. Thus, united in your submission, and subject to the bishop and the presbytery, you will be real saints.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p6"><b>3</b> I do not give you orders as if I were somebody important. For even if I am a prisoner for the Name, I have not yet reached Christian perfection. I am only beginning to be a
disciple, so I address you as my fellow students. I needed your
coaching in faith, encouragement, endurance, and patience.
 <sup>2</sup> But since love forbids me to keep silent about you, I hasten to urge you to harmonize your actions with God’s mind. For
Jesus Christ—that life from which we can’t be torn—is the
Father’s mind, as the bishops too, appointed the world over,
reflect the mind of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.i-Page_89"/>  <strong>{Page 89}</strong> 
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p7"><b>4</b> Hence you should act in accord with the bishop’s mind, as you surely do. Your presbytery, indeed, which deserves its name and is a credit to God, is as closely tied to the bishop as the strings to a harp. Wherefore your accord and harmonious love is a hymn to Jesus Christ.
 <sup>2</sup>Yes, one and all, you should form yourselves into a choir,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p7.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p7.1"><sup class="Note">176</sup></a> so that, in perfect harmony and taking your pitch from God, you may sing in unison and with one voice to the Father through Jesus Christ. Thus he will heed you, and by your good deeds he will recognize you are members of his Son. Therefore you need to abide in irreproachable unity if you really want to be God’s members forever.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p8"><b>5</b> If in so short a time I could get so close to your bishop—I do not mean in a natural way, but in a spiritual—how much more do I congratulate you on having such intimacy with
him as the Church enjoys with Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ
with the Father. That is how unity and harmony come to prevail everywhere.
 <sup>2</sup>Make no mistake about it. If anyone is not inside the sanctuary,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p8.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p8.1"><sup class="Note">177</sup></a> he lacks God’s bread.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p8.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p8.2"><sup class="Note">178</sup></a> And if the prayer of one or two has great avail, how much more that of
the bishop and the total Church.
 <sup>3</sup>He who fails to join in your worship shows his arrogance by the very fact of becoming a
schismatic. It is written, moreover, “God resists the proud.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p8.4" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p8.4"><sup class="Note">179</sup></a> Let us, then, heartily avoid resisting the bishop so that we may
be subject to God.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p9"><b>6</b> The more anyone sees the bishop modestly silent, the more he should revere him. For everyone the Master of the house sends on his business, we ought to receive as the One who sent him. It is clear, then, that we should regard the bishop as the Lord himself.
 <sup>2</sup>Indeed, Onesimus spoke very highly of your godly conduct, that you were all living by the truth and harboring no sectarianism. Nay, you heed nobody beyond what he has to say truthfully about Jesus Christ.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p9.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p9.2"><sup class="Note">180</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p10"><b>7</b> Some, indeed, have a wicked and deceitful habit of flaunting the Name about, while acting in a way unworthy of God. You must avoid them like wild beasts. For they are mad dogs which
<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.i-Page_90"/>  <strong>{Page 90}</strong> bite on the sly. You must be on your guard against them, for it is hard to heal their bite.
 <sup>2</sup>There is only one physician—of flesh yet spiritual, born yet unbegotten, God incarnate, genuine life
in the midst of death, sprung from Mary as well as God, first subject to suffering then beyond it—Jesus Christ our Lord.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p10.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p10.1"><sup class="Note">181</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.i-p11"><b>8</b> Let no one mislead you, as, indeed, you are not misled, being wholly God’s. For when you harbor no dissension that can harass you, then you are indeed living in God’s way. A cheap sacrifice<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p11.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p11.1"><sup class="Note">182</sup></a> I am, but I dedicate myself to you Ephesians—a church forever famous.

indescribable and its novelty caused amazement. The rest
of the stars, along with the sun and the moon, formed a ring
around it; yet it outshone them all, and there was bewilderment
whence this unique novelty had arisen.
 <sup>3</sup>As a result all magic lost its power and all witchcraft ceased. Ignorance was done
away with, and the ancient kingdom [of evil] was utterly destroyed, for God was revealing himself as a man, to bring newness of eternal life.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p23.7" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p23.7"><sup class="Note">201</sup></a> What God had prepared was now beginning.

 <sup>2</sup>I will do this especially if the Lord shows me that you are all, every one of you, meeting together under the influence of the grace that we owe to the Name,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.i-p24.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.i-p24.1"><sup class="Note">202</sup></a> in one faith and in union with Christ, who was “descended from David

 <sup>2</sup>Pray for the church in Syria, whence I am being sent off to Rome as a prisoner. I am the least of the faithful there—yet I have been privileged to serve God’s honor. Farewell in God the Father and in Jesus Christ, our common hope.</p>

        <i>Like the Ephesians, the Christians at Magnesia (a town some fifteen miles from Ephesus) sent delegates to greet Ignatius in Smyrna. Among them was their youthful bishop, Damas. In his letter to them Ignatius instructs them on not presuming on the youthfulness of their bishop, emphasizes the importance of unity and subjection to the Church officers, and warns them against Judaistic errors.</i>

      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p2">Every good wish in God the Father and in Jesus Christ from
Ignatius, the “God-inspired,” to the church at Magnesia on
the Maeander. In Christ Jesus, our Saviour, I greet your church
which, by reason of its union with him, is blessed with the favor
of God the Father.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p3"><b>1 </b>I was delighted to hear of your well-disciplined and godly
love; and hence, impelled by faith in Jesus Christ, I decided to write to you.

and godly name,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p3.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p3.1"><sup class="Note">204</sup></a> I sing the praises of the churches, even while I am a prisoner. I want them to confess that Jesus Christ, our perpetual Life, united flesh with spirit. I want them, too, to unite their faith with love—there is nothing better than that. Above all, I want them to confess the union of Jesus with the Father. If, with him to support us, we put up with all the spite of the prince of this world and manage to escape, we shall
get to God.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p4"><b>2</b> Yes, I had the good fortune to see you, in the persons of Damas

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.ii-Page_95"/>  <strong>{Page 95}</strong> your bishop (he’s a credit to God!), and of your worthy
presbyters, Bassus and Apollonius, and of my fellow slave, the
deacon Zotion. I am delighted with him, because he submits
to the bishop as to God’s grace, and to the presbytery as to the
law of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p5"><b>3</b> Now, it is not right to presume on the youthfulness of your bishop. You ought to respect him as fully as you respect the
authority of God the Father. Your holy presbyters, I know,
have not taken unfair advantage of his apparent youthfulness,
but in their godly wisdom have deferred to him—nay, rather,
not so much to him as to the Father of Jesus Christ, who is everybody’s bishop.
 <sup>2</sup>For the honor, then, of him who loved us, we ought to obey without any dissembling, since the real issue
is not that a man misleads a bishop whom he can see, but that
he defrauds the One who is invisible. In such a case he must
reckon, not with a human being, but with God who knows his
secrets.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p6"><b>4</b> We have not only to be called Christians, but to <i>be</i> Christians. It is the same thing as calling a man a bishop and then doing
everything in disregard of him. Such people seem to me to be
acting against their conscience, since they do not come to the
valid and authorized services.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p7"><b>5</b> Yes, everything is coming to an end, and we stand before this choice—death or life—and everyone will go “to his own place.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p7.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p7.1"><sup class="Note">205</sup></a> One might say similarly, there are two coinages, one
God’s, the other the world’s. Each bears its own
stamp—unbelievers that of this world; believers, who are spurred by
love, the stamp of God the Father through Jesus Christ. And
if we do not willingly die in union with his Passion, we do not
have his life in us.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p8"><b>6</b> I believed, then, that I saw your whole congregation in these people I have mentioned, and I loved you all. Hence I urge you
to aim to do everything in godly agreement. Let the bishop
preside in God’s place, and the presbyters take the place of the
apostolic council, and let the deacons (my special favorites)
be entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ who was
with the Father from eternity and appeared at the end [of the
world].</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p9"><sup>2</sup>Taking, then, the same attitude as God, you should all respect one another. Let no one think of his neighbor in a
carnal way; but always love one another in the spirit of Jesus
Christ. Do not let there be anything to divide you, but be in

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.ii-Page_96"/>  <strong>{Page 96}</strong> accord with the bishop and your leaders. Thus you will be an
example and a lesson of incorruptibility.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p10"><b>7</b> As, then, the Lord did nothing without the Father<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p10.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p10.1"><sup class="Note">206</sup></a> (either on his own or by the apostles) because he was at one with him,
so you must not do anything without the bishop and presbyters.
Do not, moreover, try to convince yourselves that anything
done on your own is commendable. Only what you do together
is right. Hence you must have one prayer, one petition, one
mind, one hope, dominated by love and unsullied joy—that
means you must have Jesus Christ. You cannot have anything
better than that.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p11"><sup>2</sup>Run off—all of you—to one temple of God, as it were, to
one altar, to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father,
while still remaining one with him, and returned to him.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p12"><b>8</b> Do not be led astray by wrong views or by outmoded tales<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p12.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p12.1"><sup class="Note">207</sup></a> that count for nothing. For if we still go on observing Judaism,
we admit we never received grace.
 <sup>2</sup>The divine prophets themselves lived Christ Jesus’ way. That is why they were persecuted,
for they were inspired by his grace to convince unbelievers that
God is one, and that he has revealed himself in his Son Jesus
Christ, who is his Word issuing from the silence<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p12.4" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p12.4"><sup class="Note">208</sup></a> and who won the complete approval of him who sent him.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p13"><b>9</b> Those, then, who lived by ancient practices arrived at a new
hope. They ceased to keep the Sabbath and lived by the Lord’s
Day, on which our life as well as theirs shone forth, thanks to
Him and his death, though some deny this.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p13.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p13.1"><sup class="Note">209</sup></a> Through this mystery we got our faith, and because of it we stand our ground so as to become disciples of Jesus Christ, our sole teacher.
 <sup>2</sup>How, then, can we live without him when even the prophets, who
were his disciples by the Spirit, awaited him as their teacher?
He, then, whom they were rightly expecting, raised them from
the dead, when he came.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p13.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p13.3"><sup class="Note">210</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p14"><b>10</b> We must not, then, be impervious to his kindness. Indeed,
were he to act as we do, we should at once be done for. Hence,
now we are his disciples, we must learn to live like
Christians—to be sure, whoever bears any other name does not belong to God.
 <sup>2</sup>Get rid, then, of the bad yeast<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p14.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">211</sup></a>—it has grown stale and

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.ii-Page_97"/>  <strong>{Page 97}</strong> sour—and be changed into new yeast, that is, into Jesus
Christ. Be salted in him, so that none of you go bad, for your smell will give you away.
 <sup>3</sup>It is monstrous to talk Jesus Christ
and to live like a Jew. For Christianity did not believe in Judaism, but Judaism in Christianity. People of every tongue
have come to believe in it, and so been united together in God.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p14.4" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p14.4"><sup class="Note">212</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p15"><b>11</b> I do not write in this way, my dear friends, because I have
heard that any of you are like that. Rather do I, well aware of
my humble position, want to caution you ahead, lest you fall a
prey to stupid ideas, and to urge you to be thoroughly convinced of the birth, Passion, and resurrection, which occurred
while Pontius Pilate was governor. Yes, all that was actually
and assuredly done by Jesus Christ, our Hope. God forbid that
any of you should lose it!</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p16"><b>12</b> I want to be glad about you ever so much, if, that is, I
deserve to be. For though I am a prisoner, I cannot compare
with one of you who are free. I realize that you are not conceited, for you have Jesus Christ within you. And more, I know
you are self-conscious when I praise you, just as Scripture says,
“The upright man is his own accuser.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p16.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">213</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p17"><b>13</b> Make a real effort, then, to stand firmly by the orders of
the Lord and the apostles, so that “whatever you do, you may
succeed”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.ii-p17.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.ii-p17.1"><sup class="Note">214</sup></a> in body and soul, in faith and love, in Son, Father,

bishop, your presbytery (that neatly plaited spiritual wreath!), and your godly deacons.
 <sup>2</sup> Defer to the bishop and to one another
as Jesus Christ did to the Father in the days of his flesh, and
as the apostles did to Christ, to the Father, and to the Spirit.
In that way we shall achieve complete unity.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p18"><b>14</b> I realize you are full of God. Hence I have counseled you
but briefly. Remember me in your prayers, that I may get to
God. Remember too the church in Syria—I do not deserve to

holy prayers and your love, so that the church in Syria may
have the privilege of being refreshed by means of your church.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.ii-p19"><b>15</b> The Ephesians greet you from Smyrna. I am writing to you
from there. Like you, they came here for God’s glory and have
revived me considerably, as has Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna.
The other churches also send their greetings to you in honor of
Jesus Christ. Farewell—be at one with God, for you possess an
unbreakable spirit, which is what Jesus Christ had.</p>

        <i>TO THE TRALLIANS</i>
      </h3>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p1"><i>The Christians at Tralles (a town some seventeen miles east of
Magnesia) had sent their bishop, Polybius, to greet Ignatius in Smyrna. His letter in response is characteristic. Its leading themes are unity and obedience to the Church officials—themes provoked by the spreading danger of the Docetic heresy. It contains, too, several flashes that reveal Ignatius’ character. Particularly striking is ch. 4, where he discloses his own impetuous and fervent nature which contrasts with the calm gentleness of Polybius.</i>
</p>
      <h4 id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p1.1">THE TEXT</h4>
      <p style="text-indent:0in" id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p2">Full hearty greetings in apostolic style,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p2.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p2.1"><sup class="Note">215</sup></a> and every good wish from Ignatius, the “God-inspired,” to the holy church at Tralles in Asia. You are dear to God, the Father of Jesus Christ, elect and a real credit to him, being completely at peace by
reason of the Passion of Jesus Christ, who is our Hope, since
we shall rise in union with him.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p3"><b>1</b> Well do I realize what a character you have—above reproach
and steady under strain. It is not just affected, but it comes
naturally to you, as I gathered from Polybius, your bishop. By
God’s will and that of Jesus Christ, he came to me in Smyrna,
and so heartily congratulated me on being a prisoner for Jesus
Christ that in him I saw your whole congregation.
 <sup>2</sup>I welcomed, then, your godly good will, which reached me by him, and I
gave thanks that I found you, as I heard, to be following God.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p4"><b>2</b> For when you obey the bishop as if he were Jesus Christ, you
are (as I see it) living not in a merely human fashion but in Jesus Christ’s way, who for our sakes suffered death that you

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iii-Page_99"/>  <strong>{Page 99}</strong> might believe in his death and so escape dying yourselves.
 <sup>2</sup>It is essential, therefore, to act in no way without the bishop, just as you are doing. Rather submit even to the presbytery as to the apostles of Jesus Christ. He is our Hope,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p4.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p4.1"><sup class="Note">216</sup></a> and if we live in union with him now, we shall gain eternal life.
 <sup>3</sup>Those too who are deacons of Jesus Christ’s “mysteries”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p4.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p4.3"><sup class="Note">217</sup></a> must give complete satisfaction to everyone. For they do not serve mere food and drink,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p4.5" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p4.5"><sup class="Note">218</sup></a> but minister to God’s Church. They must therefore
avoid leaving themselves open to criticism, as they would shun fire.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p5"><b>3</b> Correspondingly, everyone must show the deacons respect.
They represent Jesus Christ, just as the bishop has the role of
the Father, and the presbyters are like God’s council and an apostolic band. You cannot have a church without these.
 <sup>2</sup>I am sure that you agree with me in this.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p6">In your bishop I received the very model of your love, and I have him with me. His very bearing is a great lesson, while
his gentleness is most forceful. I imagine even the godless respect him.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p7"><sup>3</sup>While I could write about this matter more sharply, I spare you out of love. Since, too, I am a convict, I have not thought
it my place to give you orders like an apostle.
 <b>4</b> God has granted me many an inspiration, but I keep my limits, lest boasting should be my undoing. For what I need most at this point is to be on my guard and not to heed flatterers. Those who tell me . . . they are my scourge.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p7.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p7.1"><sup class="Note">219</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>To be sure, I am ever so eager to be a martyr, but I do not know if I deserve to be. Many people have no notion of my impetuous ambition. Yet it is all the more a struggle for me. What I need is gentleness by which the prince of this world is overthrown.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p8"><b>5</b> Am I incapable of writing to you of heavenly things?<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p8.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p8.1"><sup class="Note">220</sup></a> No, indeed; but I am afraid to harm you, seeing you are mere
babes. You must forgive me, but the chances are you could
not accept what I have to say and would choke yourselves.
 <sup>2</sup>Even in my own case, it is not because I am a prisoner and can

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iii-Page_100"/>  <strong>{Page 100}</strong> grasp heavenly mysteries, the ranks of the angels, the array of
principalities, things visible and invisible<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p8.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p8.3"><sup class="Note">221</sup></a>—it is not because of all that that I am a genuine disciple as yet. There is plenty missing, if we are not going to be forsaken by God.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p9"><b>6</b> I urge you, therefore—not I, but Jesus Christ’s love—use
only Christian food. Keep off foreign fare, by which I mean heresy.
 <sup>2</sup>For those people mingle Jesus Christ with their teachings just to gain your confidence under false pretenses. It is as
if they were giving a deadly poison mixed with honey and wine,
with the result that the unsuspecting victim gladly accepts it
and drinks down death with fatal pleasure.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p10"><b>7</b> Be on your guard, then, against such people. This you will
do by not being puffed up and by keeping very close to [our]<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p10.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p10.1"><sup class="Note">222</sup></a> God, Jesus Christ, and the bishop and the apostles’ precepts.
 <sup>2</sup>Inside the sanctuary a man is pure; outside he is impure. That means: whoever does anything without bishop, presbytery, and deacons does not have a clear conscience.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p11"><b>8</b> It is not because I have heard of any such thing in your case
that I write thus. No, in my love for you I am warning you
ahead, since I foresee the devil’s wiles. Recapture, then, your gentleness, and by faith (that’s the Lord’s flesh) and by love (that’s Jesus Christ’s blood) make yourselves new creatures.
 <sup>2</sup>Let none of you hold anything against his neighbor. Do not give the heathen opportunities whereby God’s people should be scoffed at through the stupidity of a few. For, “Woe to him by whose folly my name is scoffed at before any.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p11.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p11.2"><sup class="Note">223</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p12"><b>9</b> Be deaf, then, to any talk that ignores Jesus Christ, of David’s
lineage, of Mary; who was really born, ate; and drank; was
really persecuted under Pontius Pilate; was really crucified and died, in the sight of heaven and earth and the underworld.
 <sup>2</sup>He was really raised from the dead, for his Father raised him, just as his Father will raise us, who believe on him, through Christ Jesus, apart from whom we have no genuine life.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p13"><b>10</b> And if, as some atheists (I mean unbelievers) say, his suffering
was a sham (it’s really <i>they</i> who are a sham!), why, then, am I
a prisoner? Why do I want to fight with wild beasts? In that
case I shall die to no purpose. Yes, and I am maligning the
Lord too!</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p14"><b>11</b> Flee, then, these wicked offshoots which produce deadly fruit. If a man taste of it, he dies outright. They are none of the Father’s planting.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p14.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">224</sup></a> <sup>2</sup>For had they been, they would have shown

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iii-Page_101"/>  <strong>{Page 101}</strong> themselves as branches of the cross, and borne immortal fruit.
It is through the cross, by his suffering, that he summons you
who are his members. A head cannot be born without limbs,
since God stands for unity. It is his nature.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p15"><b>12</b> From Smyrna I send you my greetings in which the churches of God that are here with me join. They have altogether raised my spirits—yes, completely.
 <sup>2</sup>My very chains which I carry around for Jesus Christ’s sake, in my desire to get to God, exhort you, “Stay united and pray for one another!”</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p16">It is right that each one of you and especially the presbyters
should encourage the bishop, in honor of the Father, Jesus Christ, and the apostles.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p17"><sup>3</sup>Out of love I want you to heed me, so that my letter will not tell against you. Moreover, pray for me. By God’s mercy I
need your love if I am going to deserve the fate I long for,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p17.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p17.1"><sup class="Note">225</sup></a> and not prove a “castaway.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p17.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p17.2"><sup class="Note">226</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iii-p18"><b>13</b> The Smyrnaeans and Ephesians send their greetings with love. Remember the church of Syria in your prayers. I am not worthy to be a member of it: I am the least of their number.
Farewell in Jesus Christ.
 <sup>2</sup>Submit to the bishop as to [God’s] law, and to the presbytery too. All of you, love one another with an undivided heart.
 <sup>3</sup>My life is given for you, not only now but especially when I shall get to God.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iii-p18.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iii-p18.1"><sup class="Note">227</sup></a> I am still in danger. But

        <i>TO THE ROMANS</i>
      </h3>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p1"><i>His final letter from Smyrna, Ignatius writes to the church of Rome.
Unlike his other letters, this one is not concerned with questions of
heresy and Church unity. Rather is it an intensely personal document.
In it he reveals most clearly the spirit of the Oriental martyr; and in
a double way it is a letter to prepare his martyrdom. It is, on the one
hand, a plea to the Romans not to interfere with the fate in store for
him; and on the other hand it is, as it were, a letter to himself to brace
him for the coming ordeal. It betrays an excess of zeal which is strange
to most of us, and even repugnant to some. It must, however, be read in
the light of the fact that Ignatius was tormented by the brutality of his
Roman guard</i> (<i>his</i> “<i>ten leopards</i>” <i>as he calls them, ch.</i> 5:1), <i>and reacted
with the intemperance of a man who had already given his life away.
Some will find in the letter a perverted masochism; others will discern
in it all the splendor of the martyr spirit. No one, however, will miss
its burning sincerity or the courageous zeal of a disciple to suffer with his
Lord.</i></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p2"><i>The significant place that the Roman church held in the imagination
of Ignatius is clear from the flattering inscription, with its emphasis on
the extensiveness of that church’s charity, and from the mention of Peter and Paul</i> (<i>in that order!</i>) <i>in ch.</i> 4:3.</p>
      <h4 id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p2.3">THE TEXT</h4>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p3">Greetings in Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, from Ignatius, the “God-inspired,” to the church that is in charge of affairs in Roman quarters<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p3.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p3.1"><sup class="Note">228</sup></a> and that the Most High Father

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iv-Page_103"/>  <strong>{Page 103}</strong> and Jesus Christ, his only Son, have magnificently embraced
in mercy and love. You have been granted light both by the
will of Him who willed all that is, and by virtue of your believing in Jesus Christ, our God, and of loving him. You are a
credit to God: you deserve your renown and are to be congratulated. You deserve praise and success and are privileged to be
without blemish. Yes, you rank first in love,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p3.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p3.2"><sup class="Note">229</sup></a> being true to
Christ’s law and stamped with the Father’s name.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p3.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p3.3"><sup class="Note">230</sup></a> To you, then, sincerest greetings in Jesus Christ, our God, for you cleave
to his every commandment—observing not only their letter but
their spirit—being permanently filled with God’s grace and
purged of every stain alien to it.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p4"><b>1</b> Since God has answered my prayer to see you godly people, I have gone on to ask for more. I mean, it is as a prisoner for Christ Jesus that I hope to greet you, if indeed it be [God’s] will that I should deserve to meet my end.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p4.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p4.1"><sup class="Note">231</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>Things are off to a good start. May I have the good fortune to meet my fate without interference! What I fear is your generosity which may prove detrimental to me. For you can easily do what you want to, whereas it is hard for me to get to God unless you let me alone.
 <b>2</b> I do not want you to please men, but to please God,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p4.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p4.2"><sup class="Note">232</sup></a> just as you are doing. For I shall never again have such a chance
to get to God, nor can you, if you keep quiet, get credit for a
finer deed. For if you quietly let me alone, people will see in
me God’s Word. But if you are enamored of my mere body,
I shall, on the contrary, be a meaningless noise.
 <sup>2</sup>Grant me no more than to be a sacrifice for God while there is an altar at hand. Then you can form yourselves into a choir and sing

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iv-Page_104"/>  <strong>{Page 104}</strong> praises to the Father in Jesus Christ that God gave the bishop
of Syria the privilege of reaching the sun’s setting when he
summoned him from its rising. It is a grand thing for my life
to set on the world, and for me to be on my way to God, so
that I may rise in his presence.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p5"><b>3</b> You never grudged anyone. You taught others.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p5.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p5.1"><sup class="Note">233</sup></a> So I want you to substantiate the lessons that you bid them heed.
 <sup>2</sup>Just pray that I may have strength of soul and body so that I may not only talk [about martyrdom], but really want it.
It is not that I want merely to be called a Christian, but actually to
<i>be</i> one. Yes, if I prove to be one, then I can have the name.
Then, too, I shall be a convincing Christian only when the world sees me no more.
 <sup>3</sup>Nothing you can see has real value.
Our God Jesus Christ, indeed, has revealed himself more clearly
by returning to the Father. The greatness of Christianity lies
in its being hated by the world, not in its being convincing to
it.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p6"><b>4</b> I am corresponding with all the churches and bidding them
all realize that I am voluntarily dying for God—if, that is,
you do not interfere. I plead with you, do not do me an
unseasonable kindness. Let me be fodder for wild beasts—that is
how I can get to God. I am God’s wheat and I am being ground
by the teeth of wild beasts to make a pure loaf for Christ.
 <sup>2</sup>I would rather that you fawn on the beasts so that they may be
my tomb and no scrap of my body be left. Thus, when I have
fallen asleep, I shall be a burden to no one. Then I shall be a
real disciple of Jesus Christ when the world sees my body no
more. Pray Christ for me that by these means I may become God’s sacrifice.
 <sup>3</sup>I do not give you orders like Peter and Paul.
They were apostles: I am a convict. They were at liberty: I
am still a slave.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p6.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p6.3"><sup class="Note">234</sup></a> But if I suffer, I shall be emancipated by
Jesus Christ; and united to him, I shall rise to freedom.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p7">Even now as a prisoner, I am learning to forgo my own wishes.
 <b>5</b> All the way from Syria to Rome I am fighting with wild beasts, by land and sea, night and day, chained as I am
to ten leopards (I mean to a detachment of soldiers), who only
get worse the better you treat them. But by their injustices I
am becoming a better disciple, “though not for that reason am
I acquitted.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p7.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p7.1"><sup class="Note">235</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>What a thrill I shall have from the wild beasts
that are ready for me! I hope they will make short work of me.

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iv-Page_105"/>  <strong>{Page 105}</strong> I shall coax them on to eat me up at once and not to hold off,
as sometimes happens, through fear. And if they are reluctant,
I shall force them to it.
 <sup>3</sup>Forgive me—I know what is good for me. Now is the moment I am beginning to be a disciple. May nothing seen or unseen begrudge me making my way to Jesus
Christ. Come fire, cross, battling with wild beasts, wrenching
of bones, mangling of limbs, crushing of my whole body, cruel
tortures of the devil—only let me get to Jesus Christ!
 <b>6</b> Not the wide bounds of earth nor the kingdoms of this world will avail me anything. “I would rather die”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p7.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p7.3"><sup class="Note">236</sup></a> and get to Jesus Christ,
than reign over the ends of the earth. That is whom I am looking for—the One who died for us. That is whom I want—the
One who rose for us.
 <sup>2</sup>I am going through the pangs of being born. Sympathize with me, my brothers! Do not stand in the
way of my coming to life—do not wish death on me. Do not give back to the world one who wants to be God’s; do not trick
him with material things. Let me get into the clear light and manhood will be mine.
 <sup>3</sup>Let me imitate the Passion of my God. If anyone has Him in him, let him appreciate what I am longing for, and sympathize with me, realizing what I am going
through.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p8"><b>7</b> The prince of this world wants to kidnap me and pervert my godly purpose. None of you, then, who will be there, must abet him. Rather be on my side—that is, on God’s. Do not talk Jesus Christ and set your heart on the world.
 <sup>2</sup>Harbor no envy. If, when I arrive, I make a different plea, pay no attention to me. Rather heed what I am now writing to you. For though alive, it is with a passion for death that I am writing to you. My
Desire<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.1"><sup class="Note">237</sup></a> has been crucified and there burns in me no passion for material things. There is living water<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.2"><sup class="Note">238</sup></a> in me, which
speaks and says inside me, “Come to the Father.”
 <sup>3</sup>I take no delight in corruptible food or in the dainties of this life. What
I want is God’s bread,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.5" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.5"><sup class="Note">239</sup></a> which is the flesh of Christ, who came from David’s line<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.8" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p8.8"><sup class="Note">240</sup></a>;and for drink I want his blood: an immortal love feast indeed!</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p9"><b>8</b> I do not want to live any more on a human plane. And so it shall be, if you want it to. Want it to, so that you will be wanted! Despite the brevity of my letter, trust my request.
 <sup>2</sup>Yes, Jesus

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.iv-Page_106"/>  <strong>{Page 106}</strong> Christ will clarify it for you and make you see I am really in
earnest. He is the guileless mouth by which the Father has spoken truthfully.
 <sup>3</sup>Pray for me that I reach my goal. I have written prompted, not by human passion, but by God’s will.
If I suffer, it will be because you favored me. If I am rejected, it will be because you hated me.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p10"><b>9</b> Remember the church of Syria in your prayers. In my place
they have God for their shepherd. Jesus Christ alone will look
after them<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p10.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p10.1"><sup class="Note">241</sup></a>—he, and your love.
 <sup>2</sup>I blush to be reckoned among them, for I do not deserve it, being the least of them and
an afterthought.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p10.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p10.2"><sup class="Note">242</sup></a> Yet by his mercy I shall be something, if, that is, I get to God.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.iv-p11"><sup>3</sup>With my heart I greet you; and the churches which have
welcomed me, not as a chance passer-by, but in the name of
Jesus Christ, send their love. Indeed, even those that did not
naturally lie on my route went ahead to prepare my welcome in the different towns.
 <b>10</b> I am sending this letter to you from Smyrna by those praiseworthy Ephesians.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.iv-p11.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.iv-p11.1"><sup class="Note">243</sup></a> With me, along with many others, is Crocus—a person very dear to me.
 <sup>2</sup>I trust you have had word about those who went ahead of me from Syria to Rome for God’s glory. Tell them I am nearly there. They are all a credit to God and to you; so you should give them every assistance.
 <sup>3</sup>I am writing this to you on the twenty-fourth of August. Farewell, and hold out to the end with the patience of Jesus Christ.</p>

The Greek is: <i>prokathētai en topō chōriou Rōmaiōn.</i> The words
<i>en topō</i> might conceivably be taken as
“in dignity,” and the whole clause rendered: “Which has a precedence of dignity over the district of the Romans.” Another suggestion has been to read <i>Christou</i> for <i>chōriou</i>:
“Which presides over the district of the Romans in the place of Christ.” The most usual rendering has been: “Which
presides [has the chief seat] in the district of the region of the Romans.
This is somewhat barbarous. It also presents an ambiguity: is the presidence exercised over the
<i>whole</i> Church or only over the district in which
the Roman church has its seat? My own rendering is modeled on the
phrase
<i>ho topos tēs chōras</i>, which means “the local circumstances of the
district.” If, then, the Greek text is correct and <i>topos</i> has the sense of
“local circumstances,” the expression, literally rendered, would be:

where they made a halt before crossing by sea to Neapolis. It was from
Troas that Ignatius wrote his last three letters. While their themes
are the familiar ones of Church unity and heresy, their special importance
lies in the fact that they are directed to churches that Ignatius had actually
visited.</i> (<i>Philadelphia lay on the route he took from Laodicea to Smyrna.</i>) <i>They, therefore, reflect the issues of false teaching in more
detail. The letter to the Philadelphians indicates the nature of the
Judaistic errors which had been touched upon in the letter to the Magnesians; while that to the Smyrnaeans enlarges on Docetism.</i></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.v-p2"><i>Two friends of Ignatius, the deacons Philo and Rheus Agathopus,

brought news of the church there and of the fact that the dissident element had slighted them and
also attacked the martyr</i> (<i>chs.</i> 6:3; 11). <i>To answer these charges and to unmask the errors of his opponents, Ignatius wrote his letter. An interesting feature of it is his account of an actual debate he had with the Judaizers</i> (<i>ch.</i> 8:2).</p>

Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia in Asia—an object of the
divine mercy and firmly knit in godly unity. Yours is a deep,
abiding joy in the Passion of our Lord; and by his overflowing
mercy you are thoroughly convinced of his resurrection. You
are the very personification of eternal and perpetual joy. This
is especially true if you are at one with the bishop, and with

      <p id="vi.ii.iii.v-p4"><b>1</b> I well realize that this bishop of yours does not owe his ministry to his own efforts or to men. Nor is it to flatter his vanity that he holds this office which serves the common good.
Rather does he owe it to the love of God the Father and the

        <i>At Smyrna Ignatius had come into personal contact with Docetism.
To his mind this presented such an imminent danger to the church there
that his letter plunges at once into the theme with a vigorous affirmation
of the reality of Christ’s Passion and resurrection. Only toward the end

from Ignatius, the “God-inspired,” to the church of God the
Father and the beloved Jesus Christ, which is at Smyrna in
Asia. By God’s mercy you have received every gift; you abound

      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p5"><b>1</b> I extol Jesus Christ, the God who has granted you such
wisdom. For I detected that you were fitted out with an unshakable

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.vi-Page_113"/>  <strong>{Page 113}</strong> faith, being nailed, as it were, body and soul to the cross
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and being rooted in love by the blood
of Christ. Regarding our Lord, you are absolutely convinced
that on the human side he was actually sprung from David’s
line,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.2"><sup class="Note">270</sup></a> Son of God according to God’s will and power, actually

 <sup>2</sup>and actually crucified for us in
the flesh, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the Tetrarch.
(We are part of His fruit which grew out of his most blessed
Passion.)<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.9" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.9"><sup class="Note">272</sup></a> And thus, by his resurrection, he raised a standard<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.10" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.10"><sup class="Note">273</sup></a> to rally his saints and faithful forever—whether Jews or Gentiles—in one body of his Church.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.15" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p5.15"><sup class="Note">274</sup></a>
 <b>2</b> For it was for our sakes
that he suffered all this, to save us. And he genuinely suffered,
as even he genuinely raised himself. It is not as some unbelievers
say, that his Passion was a sham. It’s they who are a sham!
Yes, and their fate will fit their fancies—they will be ghosts
and apparitions.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p6"><b>3</b> For myself, I am convinced and believe that even after the resurrection he was in the flesh.
 <sup>2</sup>Indeed, when he came to Peter and his friends, he said to them, “Take hold of me, touch me
and see that I am not a bodiless ghost.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p6.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p6.2"><sup class="Note">275</sup></a> And they at once
touched him and were convinced, clutching his body and his
very breath. For this reason they despised death itself, and
proved its victors. Moreover, after the resurrection he ate and
drank with them<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p6.4" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p6.4"><sup class="Note">276</sup></a> as a real human being, although in spirit
he was united with the Father.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p7"><b>4</b> I urge these things on you, my friends, although I am well
aware that you agree with me. But I warn you in advance
against wild beasts in human shapes. You must not only refuse
to receive them, but if possible, you must avoid meeting them.
Just pray for them that they may somehow repent, hard as that
is. Yet Jesus Christ, our genuine life, has the power to bring it about.
 <sup>2</sup>If what our Lord did is a sham, so is my being in chains.
Why, then, have I given myself up completely to death, fire,
sword, and wild beasts? For the simple reason that near the
sword means near God. To be with wild beasts means to be
with God. But it must all be in the name of Jesus Christ. To

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.vi-Page_114"/>  <strong>{Page 114}</strong> share in his Passion I go through everything, for he who became
the perfect man gives me the strength.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p7.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p7.1"><sup class="Note">277</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p8"><b>5</b> Yet in their ignorance some deny him—or rather have been
denied by him, since they advocate death rather than the truth.
The prophets and the law of Moses have failed to convince
them—nay, to this very day the gospel and the sufferings of
each one of us have also failed, for they class our sufferings with
Christ’s.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p8.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p8.2"><sup class="Note">278</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>What good does anyone do me by praising me and then reviling my Lord by refusing to acknowledge that he
carried around live flesh? He who denies this has completely disavowed him and carries a corpse around.
 <sup>3</sup>The names of
these people, seeing they are unbelievers, I am not going to
write down. No, far be it from me even to recall them until
they repent and acknowledge the Passion, which means our
resurrection.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p9"><b>6</b> Let no one be misled: heavenly beings, the splendor of
angels, and principalities, visible and invisible, if they fail to
believe in Christ’s blood, they too are doomed. “Let him accept
it who can.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p9.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p9.1"><sup class="Note">279</sup></a> Let no one’s position swell his head, for faith
and love are everything—there is nothing preferable to them.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p10"><sup>2</sup>Pay close attention to those who have wrong notions about
the grace of Jesus Christ, which has come to us, and note how
at variance they are with God’s mind. They care nothing about
love: they have no concern for widows or orphans, for the
oppressed, for those in prison or released, for the hungry or the thirsty.
 <b>7</b> They hold aloof from the Eucharist and from services
of prayer, because they refuse to admit that the Eucharist is
the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p10.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p10.1"><sup class="Note">280</sup></a> which suffered for our
sins and which, in his goodness, the Father raised [from the
dead]. Consequently those who wrangle and dispute God’s gift
face death. They would have done better to love and so share in the resurrection.
 <sup>2</sup>The right thing to do, then, is to avoid such
people and to talk about them neither in private nor in public.
Rather pay attention to the prophets and above all to the
gospel. There we get a clear picture of the Passion and see
that the resurrection has really happened.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.vi-Page_115"/>  <strong>{Page 115}</strong> 
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p11"><b>8</b> Flee from schism as the source of mischief. You should all
follow the bishop as Jesus Christ did the Father. Follow, too,
the presbytery as you would the apostles; and respect the
deacons as you would God’s law. Nobody must do anything
that has to do with the Church without the bishop’s approval.
You should regard that Eucharist as valid which is celebrated
either by the bishop or by someone he authorizes.
 <sup>2</sup>Where the bishop is present, there let the congregation gather, just as
where Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. Without
the bishop’s supervision, no baptisms or love feasts are permitted. On the other hand, whatever he approves pleases God
as well. In that way everything you do will be on the safe side and valid.
 <b>9</b> It is well for us to come to our senses at last, while
we still have a chance to repent and turn to God. It is a fine
thing to acknowledge God and the bishop. He who pays the
bishop honor has been honored by God. But he who acts without the bishop’s knowledge is in the devil’s service.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p12"><sup>2</sup>By God’s grace may you have an abundance of everything!
You deserve it. You have brought me no end of comfort; may
Jesus Christ do the same for you! Whether I was absent or
present, you gave me your love. May God requite you! If for
his sake you endure everything, you will get to him.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p13"><b>10</b> It was good of you to welcome Philo and Rheus Agathopus as deacons of the Christ God. They accompanied me in God’s

nothing by it.
 <sup>2</sup>Prisoner as I am, I am giving my life for you—not
that it’s worth much! You did not scorn my chains and were
not ashamed of them.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p13.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p13.3"><sup class="Note">281</sup></a> Neither will Jesus Christ be ashamed

      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p14"><sup><b>11</b></sup> Your prayers have reached out as far as the church at Antioch in Syria. From there I have come, chained with these magnificent chains, and I send you all greetings. I do not, of course,
deserve to be a member of that church, seeing I am the least
among them. Yet it was [God’s] will to give me the privilege—not,
indeed, for anything I had done of my own accord, but by
his grace. Oh, I want that grace to be given me in full measure, that by your prayers I may get to God!
 <sup>2</sup>Well, then, so that your
own conduct may be perfect on earth and in heaven, it is right
that your church should honor God by sending a delegate in
his name to go to Syria and to congratulate them on being at
peace, on recovering their original numbers, and on having

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.vi-Page_116"/>  <strong>{Page 116}</strong> their own corporate life restored to them.
 <sup>3</sup> To my mind that is what God would want you to do: to send one of your number
with a letter, and thus join with them in extolling the calm which God has granted them, and the fact that they have
already reached a haven, thanks to your prayers. Seeing you
are perfect, your intentions must be perfect as well.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vi-p14.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vi-p14.2"><sup class="Note">282</sup></a> Indeed, if you want to do what is right, God stands ready to give you his help.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vi-p15"><b>12</b> The brothers in Troas send their love to you. From there I am
sending this letter to you by Burrhus. You joined with your
Ephesian brothers in sending him to be with me, and he has
altogether raised my spirits. I wish everyone would be like him,
since he is a model of what God’s ministry should be. God’s grace will repay him for all he has done for me.

in his Passion and resurrection, both bodily and spiritual, and
in unity—both God’s and yours. Grace be yours, and mercy,
peace, and endurance, forever.</p>

        <i>TO POLYCARP</i>
      </h3>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p1"><i>Along with the letter to the church of Smyrna, Ignatius wrote to its
bishop, Polycarp. One of the most distinguished figures of the Early
Church, who crowned his old age with martyrdom, Polycarp had given
Ignatius a generous welcome which the latter mentions in other letters</i>
(<i>Eph., ch</i>. 21; <i>Mag., ch</i>. 15). <i>This is an intimate and personal letter—the shortest of them all. Polycarp was the younger of the two men, perhaps
in his early forties, and Ignatius is characteristically forthright in his
advice. That the latter was most highly regarded by the bishop of Smyrna
is clear from his own letter to the Philippians and from his making a
collection of Ignatius’ correspondence</i> (<i>Polycarp, Phil., ch.</i> 13).</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p2">
        <i>The sense of Christian solidarity which bound together the local churches
is evident from the various delegations which Ignatius received
in Smyrna. The suggestion, however, in the letter to the Philadelphians
and repeated in this one to Polycarp, that the churches should send
delegates as far as Syrian Antioch to congratulate the Christians on the
cessation of persecution, is a telling witness to the universal consciousness
of the local congregations. In a day when travel was neither easy nor free
from danger, the dispatching of such messengers reflects the deep unity
of the Christian brotherhood.</i>

to press forward in your race and to urge everybody to be saved.
Vindicate your position by giving your whole attention to its
material and spiritual sides.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p4.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p4.1"><sup class="Note">285</sup></a> Make unity your concern—there

 <sup>3</sup>Devote yourself to continual prayer. Ask for
increasing insight. Be ever on the watch by keeping your spirit
alert. Take a personal interest in those you talk to, just as God
does. “Bear the diseases”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p4.4" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p4.4"><sup class="Note">287</sup></a> of everyone, like an athlete in
perfect form. The greater the toil, the greater the gain.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p5"><b>2</b> It is no credit to you if you are fond of good pupils. Rather
by your gentleness subdue those who are annoying. Not every
wound is healed by the same plaster. Relieve spasms of pain with poultices.
 <sup>2</sup>In all circumstances be “wise as a serpent,”
and perpetually “harmless as a dove.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p5.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">288</sup></a> The reason you have

visible world.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p5.3" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p5.3"><sup class="Note">289</sup></a> But ask that you may have revelations of
what is unseen. In that way you will lack nothing and have an
abundance of every gift.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p6"><sup>3</sup>Just as pilots demand winds and a storm-tossed sailor a
harbor, so times like these demand a person like you. With
your help we will get to God. As God’s athlete, be sober. The
prize, as you very well know, is immortality and eternal life.
Bound as I am with chains that you kissed,<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p6.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">290</sup></a> I give my whole self for you—cheap sacrifice though it is!</p>

anvil under the hammer. A great athlete must suffer blows to

above time, the Timeless, the Unseen, the One who became

<span class="pb" id="vi.ii.iii.vii-Page_119"/>  <strong>{Page 119}</strong> visible for our sakes, who was beyond touch and passion, yet
who for our sakes became subject to suffering, and endured everything for us.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p8"><b>4</b> Widows must not be neglected. After the Lord you must be
their protector. Do not let anything be done without your
consent; and do not do anything without God’s, as indeed you do not. Stand firm.
 <sup>2</sup>Hold services more often. Seek out everybody by name.
 <sup>3</sup>Do not treat slaves and slave girls contemptuously.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p8.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p8.1"><sup class="Note">292</sup></a> Neither must they grow insolent. But for God’s glory
they must give more devoted service, so that they may obtain
from God a better freedom. Moreover, they must not be overanxious to gain their freedom at the community’s expense, lest they prove to be slaves of selfish passion.
 <b>5</b> Flee from such wicked practices—nay, rather, preach against them.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p9">Tell my sisters to love the Lord and to be altogether contented with their husbands. Similarly urge my brothers in the
name of Jesus Christ “to love their wives as the Lord loves the Church.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p9.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p9.1"><sup class="Note">293</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>If anyone can live in chastity for the honor of
the Lord’s flesh, let him do so without ever boasting. If he boasts
of it, he is lost; and if he is more highly honored than the bishop,
his chastity is as good as forfeited. It is right for men and women
who marry to be united with the bishop’s approval. In that
way their marriage will follow God’s will and not the promptings of lust. Let everything be done so as to advance God’s honor.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p10"><b>6</b> Pay attention to the bishop so that God will pay attention
to you. I give my life as a sacrifice (poor as it is) for those who
are obedient to the bishop, the presbyters, and the deacons.
Along with them may I get my share of God’s reward! Share
your hard training together—wrestle together, run together,
suffer together, go to bed together, get up together, as God’s stewards, assessors, and assistants.
 <sup>2</sup> Give satisfaction to Him in
whose ranks you serve and from whom you get your pay.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p10.1" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p10.1"><sup class="Note">294</sup></a> Let none of you prove a deserter. Let your baptism be your

you. May I always be happy about you!</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p11"><b>7</b> News has reached me that, thanks to your prayers, the
church at Antioch in Syria is now at peace. At this I have
taken new courage and, relying on God, I have set my mind at
rest—assuming, that is, I may get to God through suffering,
and at the resurrection prove to be your disciple.
 <sup>2</sup>So, my dear Polycarp (and how richly God has blessed you!), you ought to
call a most religious council and appoint somebody whom you
regard as especially dear and diligent, and who can act as God’s
messenger. You should give him the privilege of going to Syria and of advancing God’s glory by extolling your untiring generosity.
 <sup>3</sup>A Christian does not control his own life, but gives his
whole time to God. This is God’s work, and when you have
completed it, it will be yours as well. For God’s grace gives me
confidence that you are ready to act generously when it comes
to his business. It is because I am well aware of your earnest
sincerity that I limit my appeal to so few words.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p12"><b>8</b> I have been unable to write to all the churches because I am
sailing at once (so God has willed it) from Troas to Neapolis.
I want you, therefore, as one who has the mind of God, to write
to the churches ahead and to bid them to do the same. Those
who can should send representatives, while the others should
send letters by your own delegates. In that way you will win
renown, such as you deserve, by an act that will be remembered forever.</p>
      <p id="vi.ii.iii.vii-p13"><sup>2</sup>Greetings to every one of you personally, and to the widow
of Epitropus<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.ii.iii.vii-p13.2" href="#fnf_vi.ii.iii.vii-p13.2"><sup class="Note">297</sup></a> with her children and her whole family.
Greetings to my dear Attalus. Greetings to the one who is to
be chosen to go to Syria. Grace will ever be with him and with Polycarp who sends him.
 <sup>3</sup>I bid you farewell as always in our
God, Jesus Christ. May you abide in him and so share in the
divine unity and be under God’s care. Greetings to Alce, who
means a great deal to me. Farewell in the Lord.</p>

        <i>The Letter of Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, to the Philippians</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="vi.iii.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p1"><span class="sc">At the time of his martyrdom, Polycarp, the</span> bishop of Smyrna, confessed that he had been a Christian
for eighty-six years. Since the date of his martyrdom can be fixed with reasonable certainty as occurring in <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.iii.i-p1.4"/>A.D.</span> 155
or 156, his birth could therefore not have been later than the
year 69 or 70. Thus his career spanned that critical era of the
Church’s development which witnessed, after the passing of its
apostolic founders and missionaries, the menacing growth of
persecution by the Roman State and the emergence of the
Docetic and Gnostic heresies, and—in response to this situation—the
establishment of monepiscopacy and the crystallization
of the canon of New Testament writings. In these momentous
issues Polycarp was destined to be intimately involved and to
exercise upon them the force of his commanding personality
and influence.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p2">Yet, strange to say, our sources for the life of Polycarp are
extremely meager. His own extant letter to the church in Philippi and the eyewitness account of his martyrdom reveal
much about his character and his qualities of heart and mind,
but they furnish us few data regarding the events of his life.
There is extant in a tenth century manuscript (Cod. Parisiensis Graec., 1452) an anonymous
<i>Vita</i> of Polycarp. Its
historical value is much debated. All the modern editors of
the work, Duchesne, Funk, Lightfoot, and the eminent Bollandist Delehaye, consider it to be fictitious, a composition of the
end of the fourth century. They incline to attribute it to the Pionius who signed his name in the colophon of the Martyrdom of Polycarp. Several historical critics, on the other hand,
Corssen, Schwartz, Streeter, and Cadoux, attribute the <i>Vita</i>

<span class="pb" id="vi.iii.i-Page_122"/>  <strong>{Page 122}</strong> to the presbyter and martyr Pionius of Smyrna, who suffered
for his faith in the Decian persecution. However that may be,
the author of the
<i>Vita</i> betrays no knowledge of the traditions
about Polycarp and his relations with John, the disciple of the
Lord, which we have from Irenaeus and Eusebius. His own
sources and traditions relate the foundation of the church in
Smyrna to a disciple of Paul, one Strataeus, and name a certain Bucolus as the immediate predecessor of Polycarp as bishop
of Smyrna, under whose tutelage Polycarp was prepared and
trained. Inasmuch as there is so much uncertainty as to the
reliability of “Pionius” with regard to his historical information,
the argument for his trustworthiness rests largely upon
philological and theological considerations. These tend to
confirm the opinion of those who assign it to the later date and
deny its usefulness in ascertaining any certain data with
respect to Polycarp’s life. We are on more solid ground if we rely
upon the statements of those who actually knew Polycarp in
person.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p3">Our earliest testimony to Polycarp is contained in the letters
that Ignatius addressed from Troas to the church in Smyrna
and to Polycarp during the course of his dolorous journey
to martyrdom at Rome. Ignatius’ death is generally dated in
the latter part of the reign of Trajan (<span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.iii.i-p3.4"/><span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.iii.i-p3.5"/>A.D.</span> </span> 98–117). Hence
Polycarp must have been somewhere between forty and fifty
years old at the time. He was already bishop in Smyrna; but
the tone of Ignatius’ letter to him suggests that he had not been
in this office for very long—or, at any rate, he had not as yet
exerted his authority with sufficient aggressiveness. The warning
given by the intrepid martyr to his younger episcopal colleague
respecting the grave danger of the new Docetic heresy to the
faith and unity of his flock was not without its effect.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p4">Not long after Ignatius’ departure from the Middle East—possibly
before he had reached Rome—Polycarp penned his
letter to the Philippians, in answer to several requests from
them. One of these had to do with the collection of copies of
Ignatius’ letters and also with the delegation of Church representatives which Ignatius had requested his friends in Asia and Macedonia to send to Syria for assistance to his own bereaved
and distressed flock he had left behind. Another concerned an
unfortunate incident that had recently occurred in the church
at Philippi. One of its presbyters, named Valens, and his wife,
had become involved in certain dishonest money matters, and
had been excommunicated. Polycarp was asked for advice in

<span class="pb" id="vi.iii.i-Page_123"/>  <strong>{Page 123}</strong> the pastoral handling of this affair. In addition there was the
problem of heresy, which had so deeply concerned Ignatius.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p5">Brief as it is, Polycarp’s letter gives us the measure of the
man. He was simple, humble, and direct. There was nothing
subtle about him, or pretentious. He does not appear to have
had much in the way of formal education. His Greek is without
style, without the faintest touch of rhetoric, without learned
allusion. He is not versed, as he himself admitted, in the Scriptures, i.e., the Old Testament. But he had meditated much on
Christian writings; his letter is a veritable mosaic of quotation
and allusion to them. Modern critics are fond of calling him
 “unoriginal.” It is true; he shows not the slightest interest in
theological or philosophical speculation. He never argues with
heresy, but treats it uncompromisingly with disdain and contempt. Any deviation from the norm of “the faith once delivered” provokes him to strong language. Yet if he appears harsh and unyielding with offenders against the truth as he
has received it, Polycarp can be gentle and compassionate
with human failings in the moral order—as in the case, for
example, of the presbyter Valens. He had the insight and the
method, as it were instinctively, of the true pastor of souls.
And the simplicity and honesty of his own character won him
the veneration of his church and the respect of the heathen
populace of Smyrna.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p6">Of his later years, we possess only a few reminiscences of Irenaeus, who as a young lad came under Polycarp’s tutelage.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.iii.i-p6.2" href="#fnf_vi.iii.i-p6.2"><sup class="Note">298</sup></a> Only a year or two before his martyrdom the aged bishop
made a journey to Rome to confer with Pope Anicetus regarding
the disagreement between the Asian Christians and the church
of Rome over the proper date for the celebration of Easter.
Though neither bishop could persuade the other to change his
own tradition they both maintained in amicable unity the
fellowship of communion. While in Rome, Polycarp was instrumental in converting many disciples of Marcion and the Gnostic Valentinus to orthodoxy, by his personal testimony to the apostolic faith he had received from disciples of the Lord.
It was possibly during this Roman visit also that Polycarp had

<span class="pb" id="vi.iii.i-Page_124"/>  <strong>{Page 124}</strong> his famous encounter with Marcion himself and called him
“the first-born of Satan.” Discussion of the Martyrdom of
Polycarp will be deferred for the introduction to that work.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p7">Irenaeus tells us that Polycarp wrote numerous letters of
exhortation and admonition to churches and individuals, but
the only one he cites specifically is the Letter to the Philippians. Eusebius also knows only of the Philippian letter. Its authenticity cannot be seriously questioned.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.iii.i-p7.4" href="#fnf_vi.iii.i-p7.4"><sup class="Note">299</sup></a> The original Greek text
of the letter, however, has not been preserved in its entirety,
but only the first nine chapters. These are contained in nine
late Greek manuscripts, in which ch. 9:2
is followed immediately by an incomplete text of the Epistle of Barnabas, which
begins at ch. 5:8. All these manuscripts are derived from a
single archetype. The eleventh century Codex Vaticanus
Graecus 859 is the best of the group. The thirteenth chapter
of the letter (minus the last sentence) is preserved in Greek
by Eusebius’ quotation
(<i>Hist. eccl</i>. III. 36: 13–15). For the
remainder of the letter we are dependent upon an old Latin
translation preserved with the Latin manuscripts that contain
the longer recension of the Ignatian epistles. Comparison with
the extant Greek pieces shows that the Latin version is a trustworthy translation of the original.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p8">The unity of the letter has been the subject of considerable
debate since the publication of Dr. P. N. Harrison’s exhaustive
study. According to Dr. Harrison, ch. 13, and possibly also
ch. 14, was written shortly after Ignatius left Philippi and before
his martyrdom at Rome. Chapters 1 to 12,
on the other hand,
form a separate letter, written some years later, about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vi.iii.i-p8.3"/>A.D.</span> 135–137. The references to Ignatius in this letter would appear
to assume that he was long since dead. Moreover, Dr. Harrison
believes that the heresy attacked in ch. 7 is that of Marcion,
and there is no evidence that Marcion had appeared on the
scene so early as the end of Trajan’s reign. Furthermore, the
extensive use of New Testament writings in this letter would
suggest a date closer to the middle of the second century.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p9">Dr. Harrison’s thesis is open to rebuttal. It was pointed out
by Lightfoot long ago that the Latin phrase, “Those who are
with him,” in ch. 13:2, represents a Greek idiom—“those
with him”—and that it cannot therefore be used as proof that Ignatius was still alive when Polycarp penned this line. The
statements of ch. 7 can be applied to Marcion only with some

<span class="pb" id="vi.iii.i-Page_125"/>  <strong>{Page 125}</strong> manipulation of their meaning. The fact that we know Polycarp to have called Marcion “the first-born of Satan” does not
prove that Polycarp would not have used the phrase for others
also—given his fondness for such exclamations about heretics,
as Irenaeus attests.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.iii.i-p9.4" href="#fnf_vi.iii.i-p9.4"><sup class="Note">300</sup></a> But the principal interest of Polycarp’s
letter is his use of early Christian writings; yet even so it is not
such as to exclude a dating of his letter in the second decade
of the second century, but on the contrary it would seem to
confirm the traditional view.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p10">Polycarp was acquainted with the Synoptic Gospels and
The Acts. But his citations of sayings of Jesus are often rather
freely made. His conflation of quotations may be due, of course,
to his citing them from memory. He is well versed in the Pauline
Epistles, and his references include Hebrews and the Pastorals.
His special favorite, however, is I Peter; and of the other catholic epistles he knows James and I and II John. Revelation is
not cited by him, but its chiliastic point of view was not congenial to him. He makes much use of I Clement, and there are
allusions to the Ignatian letters of the sort one would expect
from fairly recent acquaintance with them. The surprising
thing is the absence of any definite reference to the Gospel of John.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.iii.i-p10.9" href="#fnf_vi.iii.i-p10.9"><sup class="Note">301</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p11">Irenaeus repeatedly states that Polycarp had received his
tradition of faith from John, the disciple of the Lord, and other
apostles, and that “apostles in Asia” had appointed him to his
bishopric.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.iii.i-p11.2" href="#fnf_vi.iii.i-p11.2"><sup class="Note">302</sup></a> For Irenaeus this was sufficient guarantee of the
attribution of the corpus of “Johannine” writings in the New
Testament to the apostle John, son of Zebedee. Yet he never,
in so many words, states that Polycarp himself made this
identification. There is certainly no reason to distrust the
information that Polycarp had enjoyed personal converse, as
did also his contemporary Papias, bishop of Hierapolis,
with companions of Jesus, including a disciple named John;
though Polycarp himself never mentions his name. But it
is more than likely that Irenaeus has confused the true identity
of this “John.” Into the involved problem of the authorship
of the Johannine writings we cannot enter here. We know
from archaeological evidence (published since Dr. Harrison’s
book) that the Gospel of John was in circulation early in

<span class="pb" id="vi.iii.i-Page_126"/>  <strong>{Page 126}</strong> the second century.<a class="Note" id="fna_vi.iii.i-p11.7" href="#fnf_vi.iii.i-p11.7"><sup class="Note">303</sup></a> There is reason to suppose that both Ignatius and Papias were familiar with it, in which case it
is hardly possible that Polycarp should have been ignorant
of it. We know that he used The First Epistle of John. His
silence with respect to the Fourth Gospel remains an enigma.</p>
      <p id="vi.iii.i-p12">On one other subject, namely, the monarchical episcopate,
the silence of Polycarp is also problematic. This has usually
been explained as due to the absence of this organizational
arrangement in the church at Philippi. Even so, one would
have expected Polycarp to follow the example of Ignatius in
urging monepiscopacy as a safeguard of unity.</p>

        <i>The Martyrdom of Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, as Told in the Letter of the Church of Smyrna to the Church of Philomelium</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="vii.i.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p1"><span class="sc">The letter of the Church in Smyrna</span> to the
church in Philomelium, commonly known as the
Martyrdom of Polycarp, is the oldest account of the
martyrdom of a Christian for his faith, outside of the pages of
the New Testament, that has come down to us. It is also our
earliest testimony to the cult of the martyrs in the Church, i.e.,
the veneration of the relics of the saints and the annual celebration of the day of martyrdom with liturgical observances.
The story of the death of Polycarp and other companions is
that of eyewitnesses of the tragedy. There are few pieces in the
history of Christian literature that are a match for its moving
pathos and edifying effect.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p2">The writer of the narrative, who names himself Marcion,
stresses the point that it was “a martyrdom conformable to
the gospel.” The witness unto death of Polycarp and his companions was not only a mere imitation of Christ’s Passion as
recorded in the New Testament Gospels—and, indeed, many
details of the story recalled specifically similar details in the
Passion of Christ—but more than that, it was a consummation
by Christian disciples of their Lord’s promise and command of
suffering, if need be, for his name’s sake. What distinguishes
the martyrdom of a Christian from similar acts of heroism
recorded of Jewish witnesses for the law, or of pagan philosophers and teachers of moral virtue, is that the Christian suffered
not merely for the sake of loyalty and obedience to the beliefs
and practices that he held to be true and inviolable, or because
of a principle of world renunciation. Christian martyrdom
was all this and more, nothing less than a mystic communion
and conformation with One who died for our sins that he

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.i-Page_142"/>  <strong>{Page 142}</strong> might raise us eternally unto a life of holiness and everlasting joy.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p3">We do not know the exact terms whereby the profession of
Christianity was proscribed by Roman law and made subject
to the death penalty. But the crucial test always applied by
Roman magistrates was conformity to the official worship of
the Roman emperor. Failure to comply with the outward
requirements of this cult was considered an overt act of treason.
The Roman government was very lax, however, in enforcing
the State religion. Not until the year <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vii.i.i-p3.1"/>A.D.</span> 250 did it take the
initiative and attempt a concerted action to force Christians to
forswear Christ by a religious oath of allegiance to Caesar.
Meanwhile the detection of Christians was left to informers or
to popular outcry. Once apprehended, however, a Christian
who refused to yield was subject to whatever penalty or
torture a magistrate chose to employ. Very often, as in the case
of Polycarp’s fellow sufferers, Christian prisoners were used as
victims in the bloody and cruel spectacles with which the State
amused the populace in the public amphitheaters.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p4">The occasion for the outbreak of persecution at Smyrna is
not clearly indicated in our story. Much of the blame is laid
upon the enmity of the Jews toward the Christians and their
incitement of the mob for Christian victims, and Polycarp in
particular. But certain overly zealous brethren of the Church
seem to have offered themselves voluntarily—a thing that
church leaders were diligent in warning their flock against, for
one could never tell how extensive the fury of persecution might
develop from one single instance of indiscretion. One of these
volunteers, named Quintus, is described as a “Phrygian.” It
has been suggested that he was possibly known to the church
in Philomelium, and that he belonged to the fanatical sect of
Montanists, often called by the orthodox Christians “Phrygians,” from the province of origin of the sect. The Montanists
did not look askance at voluntary martyrdom, but rather
encouraged it.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.i-p4.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.i-p4.1"><sup class="Note">412</sup></a> The Montanist movement did not arise, however,
quite so early as the time of these events; though it must have
drawn its initial strength from fanatical, enthusiastic elements
already existing within the Phrygian Christian communities.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p5">The life and career of Polycarp have been treated in the
introduction to his letter to the Philippians. The Martyrdom
is our sole testimony for the circumstances and time of his death.

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.i-Page_143"/>  <strong>{Page 143}</strong> Its authenticity, at least in respect to many of the miraculous
details of the story, has been the subject of some learned
debate. But there is no good reason to apply skeptical standards,
based upon purely modern, rationalistic presuppositions, to the
narrative. The story is attested by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical
History, who quotes extensive extracts from it.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.i-p5.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.i-p5.1"><sup class="Note">413</sup></a> These quotations are useful, however, in establishing the text of the Martyrdom,
of which there are six Greek manuscripts of the eleventh
to the thirteenth centuries. There is also a group of fragments
from an encomium falsely attributed to Saint John Chrysostom.
The Latin version is very careless and not trustworthy. Armenian,
Coptic, and Syriac versions exist of the Eusebian extracts,
all of which are witness to the widespread popularity of the
story.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p6">The prayer of Polycarp in ch. 14 has been the subject of
some special study. It has many affinities with Eucharistic
prayers of a later date. With a slight adjustment of the text it
might be taken as a representative of the type of Eucharistic
consecration prayer in use in Smyrna in the middle of the
second century. Even so, there is no good reason to doubt its
being a faithful recalling of what Polycarp said. It would have
been most natural for him to repeat at such a solemn moment
of his own life’s consecration words that he had been accustomed
to use in thanksgiving for his Lord’s consecration to
sacrifice on his behalf.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p7">The various colophons attached to the end of the Martyrdom,
including the one peculiar to the Moscow manuscript (Codex
Mosquensis 159, thirteenth century), shed much light upon
the way in which these stories were preserved for posterity.
In ch. 20, direction is given to the church in Philomelium to
send copies of the Martyrdom “to the brethren elsewhere.”
Among these brethren none would have valued the account
more dearly than Irenaeus, who was so fond of recalling his
early association as a young lad with Polycarp. The Gaius
who copied the story from the papers of Irenaeus may well
have been the Roman Christian mentioned by Eusebius
(<i>Hist. eccl.</i> II. 25:6), a writer who seems to have an especial interest in
the “trophies” of the martyrs. As for the Pionius who signs
himself last in the colophon, modern critics are of two opinions.
Some identify him with the Smyrnaean presbyter of that name
who was martyred in the persecution of Decius in <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vii.i.i-p7.1"/>A.D.</span> 250.
Others believe that his remarks about the great age of the

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.i-Page_144"/>  <strong>{Page 144}</strong> copy of the Martyrdom made by Isocrates of Corinth from Gaius’
copy do not fit a date so early as 250. They would identify him
with the anonymous author of the
<i>Life of Polycarp</i>, which comes from the end of the fourth century.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.i-p8">Lastly, there has been much discussion respecting the date of
Polycarp’s martyrdom, for although the colophon gives us the
day and month, it does not give us the year in which it occurred.
Eusebius guessed that it took place under Marcus Aurelius in
the year <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="vii.i.i-p8.1"/>A.D.</span> 167. This became the accepted date until the
year 1867, when W. H. Waddington published a study on the
rhetorician Aelius Aristides, who was a friend of the proconsul
L. Statius Quadratus.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.i-p8.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.i-p8.2"><sup class="Note">414</sup></a> The result of Waddington’s study was
to fix the date of Polycarp’s martyrdom as February 23, 155.
With this date the inscriptions that have come to light naming
Quadratus and also the Asiarch Philip of Tralles are in accord.
The complete evidence is exhaustively treated in Lightfoot’s
edition of Polycarp. However, C. H. Turner and Eduard
Schwartz, working from the datum that the martyrdom took
place on “a great Sabbath,” proposed the alternative date of
February 22, 156—a leap year, in which the Sabbath of
Purim fell on the twenty-second. This latter date is more easily
reconciled with the visit of Polycarp to Rome in the time of
Pope Anicetus, who succeeded to the pontificate not earlier
than the year 154. The old Syriac Martyrology of Edessa,
which dates from the year 411, commemorates Polycarp on
February 23, and so does the Eastern Church to this day.
In the Roman Church he is commemorated on January 26,
but this date is not attested earlier than the Western martyrologies of the eighth and ninth centuries.</p>

      <h4 id="vii.i.ii-p0.2">Texts</h4>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p1">The best text, and the one used for the present translation,
is that of K. Bihlmeyer,
<i>Die apostolischen Väter,</i> Neubearbeitung
der Funkschen Ausgabe, I Teil (Sammlung ausgewählter kirchen- und dogmengeschichtlicher Quellenschriften, II Reihe,
I Heft, I Teil), Tübingen, 1924, a third revision of the text
edited by F. X. Funk,
<i>Patres apostolici,</i> 2 vols., Tübingen, 1901.
Bihlmeyer’s text was reprinted, with copious bibliography,
in the collection of Acts of the Martyrs by R. Knopf,
<i>Ausgewählte Märtyrerakten,</i> 3d rev. edition by G. Krüger (Sammlung
ausgewählter kirchen- und dogmengeschichtlicher Quellenschriften,
N. F. 3), J. C. B. Mohr, Tübingen, 1929. Indispensable, however, is the text and commentary of J. B. Lightfoot,
<i>The Apostolic Fathers,</i> Part II, “S. Ignatius, S. Polycarp,”
Revised Texts with Introductions, Notes, Dissertations, and
Translations, 3 vols., 2d ed., London, 1889. Lightfoot’s text
was reprinted again in the edition of J. R. Harmer,
<i>The Apostolic Fathers,</i> Revised Texts with Short Introductions and
English Translations, pp. 185–211, London, 1912. Lightfoot’s
text, collated with that of K. Lake, was published in pamphlet form,
<i>The Martyrdom of Polycarp</i> (Texts for Students, No. 44),
S.P.C.K., London, 1930.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p2">Other editions of the text, and references to Eusebius and the
<i>Vita Polycarpi</i> attributed to Pionius, will be found listed in
the introduction to Polycarp’s Letter to the Philippians,
namely, those of Th. Zahn, A. Hilgenfeld, K. Lake (Vol. II,
1913, pp. 309–345), A. Lelong, and G. Bosio. Special studies
of the text tradition are Hermann Müller,
<i>Aus der Überlieferungsgeschichte des Polykarp-Martyrium,
Eine hagiographische Studie,</i> Paderborn, 1908; and E. Schwartz,
<i>De Pionio et Polycarpo,</i>

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.ii-Page_146"/>  <strong>{Page 146}</strong> Göttingen, 1905. Both these studies are critical of the received
tradition of the Greek manuscripts. Some of Schwartz’s
suggestions were adopted by Bihlmeyer.</p>
      <h4 id="vii.i.ii-p2.1">Translations, Commentaries, and Reference Works</h4>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p3">Translations into English of the Martyrdom will be found
in the works cited in the bibliography of Polycarp’s Letter:
<i>The Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>, B. Jackson, F. X. Glimm (pp. 147–163),
J. A. Kleist (pp. 85–102), and E. J. Goodspeed (pp. 245–256);
and also in the texts of Lightfoot and Lake, listed above.
Lelong’s text includes a French translation (pp. 128–161);
and Bosio’s, an Italian (pp. 203–247). A German translation
will be found in G. Rauschen, <i>Frühchristliche Apologeten und
Märtyrerakten</i> (Bibliothek der Kirchenväter, 14), Vol. II,
pp. 297–308, Kempten and Munich, 1913. An English translation
with notes, based on the text of Knopf, is given in E. C. E.
Owen, <i>Some Authentic Acts of the Early Martyrs</i>, pp. 31–41,
129–134, Oxford, 1927.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p4">In addition to the reference works and dictionary articles
listed in the bibliography to Polycarp’s Letter, one should consult
the bibliography on the literature of the martyrs, in
Knopf-Krüger’s <i>Ausgewählte Märtyrerakten</i>, pp. vi–ix. To this
list may be added Donald W. Riddle, <i>The Martyrs, A Study in
Social Control</i>, University of Chicago Press, 1931; and Hans
Freiherr von Campenhausen, <i>Die Idee des Martyriums in der alten
Kirche</i>, Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1936; and the

      <h4 id="vii.i.ii-p4.1">Special Studies</h4>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p5">Considerable skepticism respecting the historical trustworthiness
of the Martyrdom of Polycarp was expressed by
Hermann Müller, “Das Martyrium Polycarpi, Ein Beitrag zur
altchristlichen Heiligengeschichte,” <i>Römische Quartalschrift</i>, 22
(1908), pp. 1–16. Müller’s study was effectively answered by
Bernhard Sepp, <i>Das Martyrium Polycarpi</i>, Regensburg, 1911;
Heinrich Baden, “Der Nachahmungsgedanke im Polykarpmartyrium,”
<i>Theologie und Glaube</i>, 3 (1911), pp.115–122, and
“Das Polykarpmartyrium,” <i>Pastor bonus</i>, 24 (1911), pp.
705–713, 25 (1912), pp. 71–81, 136—151; and Wilhelm Reuning,

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.ii-Page_147"/>  <strong>{Page 147}</strong> <i>Zur Erklärung des Polykarpmartyriums,</i> Darmstadt, 1917.
Reuning’s monograph is the best single treatment of the various
problems of historicity and interpretation of the work. See also

      <h4 id="vii.i.ii-p5.2">Date of Polycarp’s Martyrdom</h4>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p6">Very few scholars, since the work of Waddington, have
defended the traditional Eusebian date: see J. Chapman,
“La Chronologie des prémières listes épiscopales de Rome,”
<i>Revue Bénédictine, </i>19 (1902), pp. 145–149 (“La Date de la mort
de S. Polycarpe”); and Daniel Völter, <i>Polykarp und Ignatius
und die ihnen zugeschriebenen Briefe </i>(Die apostolischen Väter neu
untersucht, Vol. II, 2), Leiden, 1910. For the date February 23,
155, established by Waddington, Lightfoot’s discussion is
fundamental, <i>The Apostolic Fathers,</i> Part 2, Vol. I, pp. 646–722.
Also for this date see T. Randall, “The Date of St. Polycarp’s
Martyrdom,” <i>Studia Biblica, </i>By Members of the University of
Oxford, I (1885), pp. 175–207; Peter Corssen, “Das Todesjahr

Datum des Todes des hl. Polykarps,” <i>Der Katholik </i>(94, Vierte
Folge, XIII, 1914), pp. 135–142. For the date of February 22,
156, the basic studies are those of C. H. Turner, “The Day and
Year of St. Polycarp’s Martyrdom,” <i>Studia Biblica et Ecclesiastica, </i>
By Members of the University of Oxford, II (1890), pp.
105–155; and E. Schwartz, <i>Christliche und jüdische Ostertafeln </i>

to defend a later dating see Henri Grégoire and Paul Orgel in
<i>Analecta Bollandiana, </i>69 (1951), pp. 1–38; and W. Telfer in

      <h4 id="vii.i.ii-p6.1">The Prayer  of Polycarp</h4>
      <p id="vii.i.ii-p7">Its liturgical character was first studied by J. Armitage
Robinson, “Liturgical Echoes in Polycarp’s Prayer,”
<i>The Expositor</i>, Fifth Series, IX (1899), pp. 63–72, and later by Hans
Lietzmann, “Ein liturgisches Bruckstück des zweiten Jahrhunderts,”
<i>Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie,</i> 54 (N.F.,
19; 1912), pp. 56–61. Robinson returned to the subject in
“The ‘Apostolic Anaphora’ and the Prayer of St. Polycarp,”
<i>The Journal of Theological Studies,</i> 21 (1920), pp. 97–105, to which
reply was made by J. W. Tyrer, “The Prayer of St. Polycarp
and Its Concluding Doxology,” <i>ibid.</i>, 23 (1922), pp. 390–392;
Robinson made further answer in “The Doxology in the

      <p id="vii.i.iii-p6">The church of God that sojourns at Smyrna to the church
of God that sojourns at Philomelium, and to all those of the
holy and Catholic Church who sojourn in every place: may
mercy, peace, and love be multiplied from God the Father and
our Lord Jesus Christ.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p6.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">415</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p7"><b>1</b> We write you, brethren, the things concerning those who
suffered martyrdom, especially the blessed Polycarp, who put
an end to the persecution by sealing it, so to speak, through his
own witness. For almost everything that led up to it happened
in order that the Lord might show once again a martyrdom
conformable to the gospel.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p7.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p7.1"><sup class="Note">416</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>For he waited to be betrayed, just as the Lord did, to the end that we also might be imitators of
him, “not looking only to that which concerns ourselves, but
also to that which concerns our neighbors.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p7.5" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p7.5"><sup class="Note">417</sup></a> For it is a mark
of true and steadfast love for one not only to desire to be saved
oneself, but all the brethren also.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p8"><b>2</b> Blessed and noble, indeed, are all the martyrdoms that have
taken place according to God’s will; for we ought to be very reverent in ascribing to God power over all things.
 <sup>2</sup>For who would not admire their nobility and patient endurance and love
of their Master? Some of them, so torn by scourging that the
anatomy of their flesh was visible as far as the inner veins and
arteries, endured with such patience that even the bystanders
took pity and wept; others achieved such heroism that not one
of them uttered a cry or a groan, thus showing all of us that
at the very hour of their tortures the most noble martyrs of

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_150"/>  <strong>{Page 150}</strong> Christ were no longer in the flesh, but rather that the Lord stood by them and conversed with them.
 <sup>3</sup>And giving themselves over to the grace of Christ they despised the tortures of
this world, purchasing for themselves in the space of one hour
the life eternal. To them the fire of their inhuman tortures was
cold; for they set before their eyes escape from the fire that is
everlasting and never quenched,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p8.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p8.1"><sup class="Note">418</sup></a> while with the eyes of their
heart they gazed upon the good things reserved for those that
endure patiently, “which things neither ear has heard nor eye
has seen, nor has there entered into the heart of man.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p8.6" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p8.6"><sup class="Note">419</sup></a> But they were shown to them by the Lord, for they were no longer
men, but were already angels.
 <sup>4</sup>Similarly, those condemned to the wild beasts endured fearful punishments, being made to
lie on sharp shells and punished with other forms of various
torments, in order that [the devil]<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p8.10" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p8.10"><sup class="Note">420</sup></a> might bring them, if
possible, by means of the prolonged punishment, to a denial
of their faith.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p9"><b>3</b> Many, indeed, were the machinations of the devil against
them. But, thanks be to God, he did not prevail against them
all. For the most noble Germanicus encouraged their timidity
through his own patient endurance—who also fought with the
beasts in a distinguished way. For when the proconsul, wishing
to persuade him, bade him have pity on his youth, he forcibly
dragged the wild beast toward himself,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p9.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p9.2"><sup class="Note">421</sup></a> wishing to obtain
more quickly a release from their wicked and lawless life.
 <sup>2</sup>From this circumstance, all the crowd, marveling at the heroism of
the God-loving and God-fearing race of the Christians, shouted:
“Away with the atheists!<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p9.5" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p9.5"><sup class="Note">422</sup></a> Make search for Polycarp!”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p10"><b>4</b> But a Phrygian,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p10.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p10.1"><sup class="Note">423</sup></a> named Quintus, lately arrived from Phrygia, took fright when he saw the wild beasts. In fact, he
was the one who had forced himself and some others to come
forward voluntarily. The proconsul by much entreaty persuaded him to take the oath and to offer the sacrifice. For this
reason, therefore, brethren, we do not praise those who come
forward of their own accord, since the gospel does not teach
us so to do.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p10.5" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p10.5"><sup class="Note">424</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p11"><b>5</b> The most admirable Polycarp, when he first heard of it, was

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_151"/>  <strong>{Page 151}</strong> not perturbed, but desired to remain in the city. But the
majority induced him to withdraw, so he retired to a farm not
far from the city and there stayed with a few friends, doing
nothing else night and day but pray for all men and for the
churches throughout the world, as was his constant habit.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p11.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p11.2"><sup class="Note">425</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>And while he was praying, it so happened, three days before
his arrest, that he had a vision and saw his pillow blazing with
fire, and turning to those who were with him he said, “I must be burned alive.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p12"><b>6</b> And while those who were searching for him continued their
quest, he moved to another farm, and forthwith those searching
for him arrived. And when they did not find him, they seized
two young slaves, one of whom confessed under torture.
 <sup>2</sup>For it was really impossible to conceal him, since the very ones
who betrayed him were of his own household.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p12.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p12.1"><sup class="Note">426</sup></a> And the chief
of the police, who chanced to have the same name as Herod,
was zealous to bring him into the arena in order that he might
fulfill his own appointed lot of being made a partaker with
Christ; while those who betrayed him should suffer the punishment of Judas himself.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p13"><b>7</b> Taking, therefore, the young slave on Friday about
suppertime, the police, mounted and with their customary arms, set
out as though “hasting after a robber.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p13.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p13.1"><sup class="Note">427</sup></a> And late in the evening they came up with him and found him in bed in the upper
room of a small cottage. Even so he could have escaped to
another farm, but he did not wish to do so, saying, “God’s
will be done.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p13.3" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p13.3"><sup class="Note">428</sup></a>
 <sup>2</sup>Thus, when he heard of their arrival, he went
downstairs and talked with them, while those who looked on
marveled at his age and constancy, and at how there should
be such zeal over the arrest of so old a man. Straightway he
ordered food and drink, as much as they wished, to be set before
them at that hour, and he asked them to give him an hour so that he might pray undisturbed.
 <sup>3</sup>And when they consented, he stood and prayed—being so filled with the grace of God
that for two hours he could not hold his peace, to the amazement of those who heard. And many repented that they had
come to get such a devout old man.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p14"><b>8</b> When at last he had finished his prayer, in which he remembered
all who had met with him at any time, both small and
great, both those with and those without renown, and the
whole Catholic Church throughout the world, the hour of

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_152"/>  <strong>{Page 152}</strong> departure having come, they mounted him on an ass and
brought him into the city.
 <sup>2</sup> It was a great Sabbath.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p14.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p14.2"><sup class="Note">429</sup></a> And there
the chief of the police, Herod, and his father, Nicetas, met
him and transferred him to their carriage, and tried to persuade
him, as they sat beside him, saying, “What harm is there to say
`Lord Caesar,’ and to offer incense and all that sort of thing,
and to save yourself?”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p15">At first he did not answer them.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p15.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p15.1"><sup class="Note">430</sup></a> But when they persisted,
he said, “I am not going to do what you advise me.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p16"><sup>3</sup>Then when they failed to persuade him, they uttered dire
threats and made him get out with such speed that in dismounting from the carriage he bruised his shin. But without
turning around, as though nothing had happened, he proceeded
swiftly, and was led into the arena, there being such a
tumult in the arena that no one could be heard.
 <b>9</b> But as Polycarp was entering the arena, a voice from heaven<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p16.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">431</sup></a> came to him, saying, “Be strong, Polycarp, and play the man.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p16.3" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p16.3"><sup class="Note">432</sup></a> No one saw the one speaking, but those of our people who were
present heard the voice.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p16.8" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p16.8"><sup class="Note">433</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p17">And when finally he was brought up, there was a great
tumult on hearing that Polycarp had been arrested.
 <sup>2</sup>Therefore, when he was brought before him, the proconsul asked him if he
were Polycarp. And when he confessed that he was, he tried
to persuade him to deny [the faith], saying, “Have respect to
your age”—and other things that customarily follow this, such
as, “Swear by the fortune of Caesar; change your mind; say,
‘Away with the atheists!’”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p18">But Polycarp looked with earnest face at the whole crowd of
lawless heathen in the arena, and motioned to them with his
hand. Then, groaning and looking up to heaven, he said, “Away with the atheists!”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p19"><sup>3</sup>But the proconsul was insistent and said: “Take the oath,
and I shall release you. Curse Christ.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p20">Polycarp said: “Eighty-six years I have served him, and he
never did me any wrong. How can I blaspheme my King who
saved me?”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p21"><b>10</b> And upon his persisting still and saying, “Swear by the
fortune of Caesar,” he answered, “If you vainly suppose that I
shall swear by the fortune of Caesar, as you say, and pretend
that you do not know who I am, listen plainly: I am a

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_153"/>  <strong>{Page 153}</strong> Christian. But if you desire to learn the teaching of Christianity, appoint a day and give me a hearing.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p22"><sup>2</sup>The proconsul said, “Try to persuade the people.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p23">But Polycarp said, “You, I should deem worthy of an
account; for we have been taught to render honor, as is
befitting, to rulers and authorities appointed by God<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p23.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p23.1"><sup class="Note">434</sup></a> so far
as it does us no harm; but as for these, I do not consider them
worthy that I should make defense to them.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p24"><b>11</b> But the proconsul said: “I have wild beasts. I shall throw
you to them, if you do not change your mind.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p25">But he said: “Call them. For repentance from the better to
the worse is not permitted us; but it is noble to change from
what is evil to what is righteous.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p26"><sup>2</sup>And again [he said] to him, “I shall have you consumed
with fire, if you despise the wild beasts, unless you change your
mind.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p27">But Polycarp said: “The fire you threaten burns but an hour
and is quenched after a little; for you do not know the fire of
the coming judgment and everlasting punishment that is laid
up for the impious. But why do you delay? Come, do what you will.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p28"><b>12</b> And when he had said these things and many more besides he
was inspired with courage and joy, and his face was full of grace,
so that not only did it not fall with dismay at the things said
to him, but on the contrary, the proconsul was astonished, and
sent his own herald into the midst of the arena to proclaim three
times: “Polycarp has confessed himself to be a Christian.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p29"><sup>2</sup>When this was said by the herald, the entire crowd of heathen
and Jews who lived in Smyrna<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p29.3" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p29.3"><sup class="Note">435</sup></a> shouted with uncontrollable
anger and a great cry: “This one is the teacher of Asia, the
father of the Christians, the destroyer of our gods, who teaches
many not to sacrifice nor to worship.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p29.5" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p29.5"><sup class="Note">436</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p30">Such things they shouted and asked the Asiarch Philip<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p30.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p30.2"><sup class="Note">437</sup></a> that he let loose a lion on Polycarp. But he said it was not
possible for him to do so, since he had brought the wild-beast sports to a close.
 <sup>3</sup>Then they decided to shout with one accord that he burn Polycarp alive. For it was necessary that the
vision which had appeared to him about his pillow should be
fulfilled, when he saw it burning while he was praying, and

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_154"/>  <strong>{Page 154}</strong> turning around had said prophetically to the faithful who were
with him, “I must be burned alive.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p30.7" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p30.7"><sup class="Note">438</sup></a></p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p31"><b>13</b> Then these things happened with such dispatch, quicker than
can be told—the crowds in so great a hurry to gather wood
and faggots from the workshops and the baths, the Jews being
especially zealous, as usual, to assist with this.
 <sup>2</sup>When the fire was ready, and he had divested himself of all his clothes and
unfastened his belt, he tried to take off his shoes, though he was
not heretofore in the habit of doing this because [each of]
the faithful always vied with one another as to which of them
would be first to touch his body. For he had always been
honored, even before his martyrdom, for his holy life.
 <sup>3</sup>Straightway then, they set about him the material prepared for the
pyre. And when they were about to nail him also, he said:
“Leave me as I am. For he who grants me to endure the fire
will enable me also to remain on the pyre unmoved, without
the security you desire from the nails.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p32"><b>14</b> So they did not nail him, but tied him. And with his hands
put behind him and tied, like a noble ram out of a great flock
ready for sacrifice, a burnt offering ready and acceptable to
God, he looked up to heaven and said:</p>
      <p style="margin-left:.25in; text-indent:0in" id="vii.i.iii-p33">“Lord God Almighty,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p33.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p33.1"><sup class="Note">439</sup></a> Father of thy beloved and blessed
Servant Jesus Christ, through whom we have received full
knowledge of thee, ‘the God of angels and powers and all
creation’<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p33.7" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p33.7"><sup class="Note">440</sup></a> and of the whole race of the righteous who live in thy presence:
 <sup>2</sup> I bless thee, because thou hast deemed me worthy of this day and hour,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p33.10" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p33.10"><sup class="Note">441</sup></a> to take my part in the number of the martyrs, in the cup of thy Christ,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p33.12" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p33.12"><sup class="Note">442</sup></a> for
‘resurrection to eternal life’<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p33.16" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p33.16"><sup class="Note">443</sup></a> of soul and body in the immortality of the Holy Spirit; among whom may I be received
in thy presence this day as a rich and acceptable sacrifice,
just as thou hast prepared and revealed beforehand and
fulfilled, thou that art the true God without any falsehood.
 <sup>3</sup>For this and for everything I praise thee, I bless thee, I
glorify thee, through the eternal and heavenly High Priest,
Jesus Christ, thy beloved Servant, through whom be glory
to thee with him and Holy Spirit both now and unto the
ages to come. Amen.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p34"><b>15</b> And when he had concluded the Amen and finished his
prayer, the men attending to the fire lighted it. And when the

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_155"/>  <strong>{Page 155}</strong> flame flashed forth, we saw a miracle, we to whom it was given
to see. And we are preserved in order to relate to the rest what happened.
 <sup>2</sup>For the fire made the shape of a vaulted chamber,
like a ship’s sail filled by the wind, and made a wall around the
body of the martyr. And he was in the midst, not as burning
flesh, but as bread baking or as gold and silver refined in a
furnace. And we perceived such a sweet aroma as the breath of
incense or some other precious spice.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p35"><b>16</b> At length, when the lawless men saw that his body could not
be consumed by the fire, they commanded an executioner to
go to him and stab him with a dagger. And when he did this
[a dove and]<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p35.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p35.1"><sup class="Note">444</sup></a> a great quantity of blood came forth, so that
the fire was quenched and the whole crowd marveled that there
should be such a difference between the unbelievers and the elect.
 <sup>2</sup>And certainly the most admirable Polycarp was one of
these [elect], in whose times among us he showed himself an
apostolic and prophetic teacher and bishop of the Catholic
Church in Smyrna.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p35.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p35.2"><sup class="Note">445</sup></a> Indeed, every utterance that came from
his mouth was accomplished and will be accomplished.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p36"><b>17</b> But the jealous and malicious evil one, the adversary of the
race of the righteous, seeing the greatness of his martyrdom
and his blameless life from the beginning, and how he was
crowned with the wreath of immortality and had borne away
an incontestable reward, so contrived it that his corpse should
not be taken away by us, although many desired to do this and to have fellowship with his holy flesh.
 <sup>2</sup>He instigated Nicetas, the
father of Herod and brother of Alce,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p36.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p36.1"><sup class="Note">446</sup></a> to plead with the magistrate not to give up his body, “else,” said he, “they will
abandon the Crucified and begin worshiping this one.” This
was done at the instigation and insistence of the Jews, who also
watched when we were going to take him from the fire, being
ignorant that we can never forsake Christ, who suffered for the
salvation of the whole world of those who are saved, the faultless
for the sinners,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p36.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p36.2"><sup class="Note">447</sup></a> nor can we ever worship any other.
 <sup>3</sup>For we worship this One as Son of God, but we love the martyrs as
disciples and imitators of the Lord, deservedly so, because of
their unsurpassable devotion to their own King and Teacher.
May it be also our lot to be their companions and fellow
disciples!</p>
      <span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_156"/>  <strong>{Page 156}</strong> 
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p37"><b>18</b> The captain of the Jews, when he saw their contentiousness,
set it [i.e., his body] in the midst and burned it, as was their custom.
 <sup>2</sup>So we later took up his bones, more precious than
costly stones and more valuable than gold, and laid them away in a suitable place.
 <sup>3</sup>There the Lord will permit us, so far as
possible, to gather together in joy and gladness to celebrate
the day of his martyrdom as a birthday, in memory of those
athletes who have gone before, and to train and make ready
those who are to come hereafter.</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p38"><b>19</b> Such are the things concerning the blessed Polycarp, who,
martyred at Smyrna along with twelve others from Philadelphia,
is alone remembered so much the more by everyone, that he
is even spoken of by the heathen in every place. He was not
only a noble teacher, but also a distinguished martyr, whose
martyrdom all desire to imitate as one according to the gospel of Christ.
 <sup>2</sup>By his patient endurance he overcame the wicked
magistrate and so received the crown of immortality; and he
rejoices with the apostles and all the righteous to glorify God
the Father Almighty and to bless our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Saviour of our souls and Helmsman of our bodies and Shepherd<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p38.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p38.1"><sup class="Note">448</sup></a> of the Catholic Church throughout the world.</p>

      <p id="vii.i.iii-p43"><sup>3</sup>I, Pionius,<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p43.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p43.1"><sup class="Note">454</sup></a> again wrote it from the aforementioned copy,
having searched for it according to a revelation of the blessed
Polycarp, who appeared to me, as I shall explain in the sequel.
I gathered it together when it was almost worn out with age,
in order that the Lord Jesus Christ might bring me also with
his elect unto his heavenly Kingdom. To him be glory with the

      <h4 id="vii.i.iii-p43.2">Another Epilogue  from the Moscow Manuscript</h4>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p44"><b>23</b> These things Gaius copied from the papers of Irenaeus. He
also lived with Irenaeus, who had been a disciple of the holy Polycarp.
 <sup>2</sup>For this Irenaeus, at the time of the martyrdom of
Bishop Polycarp, was in Rome and taught many; and many of
his excellent and orthodox writings are in circulation, in which
he mentions Polycarp, for he was taught by him.<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p44.1" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p44.1"><sup class="Note">455</sup></a> He ably refuted every heresy and handed down the ecclesiastical and
Catholic rule, as he had received it from the saint.
 <sup>3</sup>He says this also: that once when Marcion, after whom the Marcionites are
called, met the holy Polycarp and said, “Do you know us, Polycarp?”
he said to Marcion, “I know you; I know the first-born of Satan.”<a class="Note" id="fna_vii.i.iii-p44.2" href="#fnf_vii.i.iii-p44.2"><sup class="Note">456</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>And this fact is also found in the writings of
Irenaeus, that on the day and at the hour when Polycarp was
martyred in Smyrna, Irenaeus, being in the city of Rome,

<span class="pb" id="vii.i.iii-Page_158"/>  <strong>{Page 158}</strong> heard a voice like a trumpet saying, “Polycarp has suffered
martyrdom.”</p>
      <p id="vii.i.iii-p45"><sup>5</sup>From these papers of Irenaeus, then, as was said above, Gaius
made a copy, and from Gaius’ copy Isocrates made another in
Corinth. And I, Pionius, again from the copies of Isocrates
wrote according to the revelation of holy Polycarp, when I
searched for it, and gathered it together when it was almost
worn out with age, in order that the Lord Jesus Christ might
bring me with his elect unto his heavenly Kingdom. To whom
be glory with the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

        <i>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, Commonly Called the Didache</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="viii.i.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p1"><span class="sc">No document of the early church has proved</span>
so bewildering to scholars as this apparently innocent
tract which was discovered by Philotheos Byrennios in
1873. The Didache or Teaching (for that is what the Greek
word means) falls into two parts. The first is a code of Christian
morals, presented as a choice between the way of life and
the way of death. The second part is a manual of Church Order
which, in a well-arranged manner, lays down some simple,
at times even naïve, rules for the conduct of a rural congregation.
It deals with such topics as baptism, fasting, the Lord’s
Supper, itinerant prophets, and the local ministry of bishops
and deacons. It concludes with a warning paragraph on the
approaching end of the world.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p2">At one time this tract was viewed as a very ancient product—as
early as <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="viii.i.i-p2.1"/>A.D.</span> 70 or 90. Recent study, however, has conclusively
shown that, in the form we have it, it belongs to the
second century. There is, nevertheless, no unanimity among
scholars about its exact date or purpose. It has appropriately
been called the “spoiled child of criticism”; and it will probably
need a good deal more spoiling before its riddle is finally
solved.</p>
      <h4 id="viii.i.i-p2.2">The “Two Ways”</h4>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p3">The literary problem of the Didache is extremely complex
and only the bare outlines can be sketched here. As it stands,
the document bears a close relationship to several other early
Christian writings. The moral catechism or “Two Ways” of
its opening chapters (chs. 1 to 5) appears in a rather different
version at the end of the Letter of Barnabas (between <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="viii.i.i-p3.1"/>A.D.</span>

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.i-Page_162"/>  <strong>{Page 162}</strong> 100 and 130), and has also come down to us as an independent
document in a Latin translation. Much of this material, furthermore,
turns up in the fourth century Apostolic Church Order
(with many interpolations) and in the <i>Life of Schnudi</i> (fifth
century). The connection between all these documents has
been very closely studied, and differing opinions are held about
it. Some claim that the author of Barnabas invented the “Two
Ways.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p3.2" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p3.2"><sup class="Note">457</sup></a> Others contend that the “Two Ways” was originally
an independent catechism (perhaps Jewish in origin), and that
it has been incorporated in different forms by the various
compilers.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p3.3" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p3.3"><sup class="Note">458</sup></a> Perhaps the most reasonable explanation to account
for the many complexities is as follows:</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p4">The “Two Ways” was an independent catechism current in
several versions,<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p4.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p4.1"><sup class="Note">459</sup></a> of which three have come down to us. None
represents the original in its pure form. Barnabas’ is the earliest
version we possess, but it suffers from displacements, and here
and there the author has freely rendered his source in his own
style.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p4.3" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p4.3"><sup class="Note">460</sup></a> The second form is that found (with minor variations)
in the Latin, the Apostolic Church Order, and the <i>Life of
Schnudi.</i> This has preserved the original order, but it displays an ecclesiastical tendency<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p4.4" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p4.4"><sup class="Note">461</sup></a> and has interpolated a further
section (= Did. 3:1–6, commonly called “the fences”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p4.6" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p4.6"><sup class="Note">462</sup></a>).
 The final form is that in the Didache. It is distinguished by the
addition of yet another insertion—sayings from the Gospels
and other sources (chs. 1:3 to 2:1).</p>
      <h4 id="viii.i.i-p4.7">Date and Place of the Didache</h4>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p5">The first five chapters of the Teaching, then, represent a late
form of an original catechism into which the Didachist has

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.i-Page_163"/>  <strong>{Page 163}</strong> inserted en bloc and not very neatly<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p5.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p5.1"><sup class="Note">463</sup></a> some distinctively
Christian sayings. They betray a knowledge of Matthew and
Luke, and one is clearly derived from the Shepherd of Hermas
(ch. 1:5 = <a class="scripRef" id="viii.i.i-p5.2">Man. 2</a>:4.–6), which was written about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="viii.i.i-p5.3"/>A.D.</span> 100.
Another indication of the date of the Didache is to be found in
ch. 16, where a citation from the Letter of Barnabas appears
(ch. 16:2 = Barn. 4:9). There can be little doubt that we
are dealing with a second century document which reveals
a wide canon of Scripture, including Barnabas and Hermas.
The <i>terminus ad quem</i> is to be set by the quotations from the
Teaching in a Syrian church order called the Didascalia. This
dates from the early third century.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p6">That the Didache comes from Alexandria<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p6.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p6.1"><sup class="Note">464</sup></a> is suggested by
several factors. The “Two Ways” was in circulation there, for
the Letter of Barnabas and the Apostolic Church Order come
from that locality. It is possible, but not certain, that Clement
of Alexandria knew our Didache.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p6.2" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p6.2"><sup class="Note">465</sup></a> The Teaching’s liberal
attitude toward the New Testament canon, apparently
including Barnabas and Hermas, bespeaks Alexandria. Furthermore,
up to the fourth century the Teaching was highly
regarded in Egypt, itself hovering on the verge of the canon,
and being mentioned by Athanasius as suitable for catechetical
reading (Festal Letter, ch. 39). Then again, Serapion of
Thmuis (fourth century) has a quotation from the Didache in
his Eucharistic prayer. In view of the conservative nature of
these prayers, this is a weighty factor.</p>
      <h4 id="viii.i.i-p6.3">The Church Order of the Didache</h4>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p7">The second part of the Teaching (chs. 6 to 15) is a manual
of Church Order. It has generally been held that the Didachist
himself wrote this section of the work, adding it to the “Two
Ways.” It poses, however, very difficult problems, and three
main views are current about it. Some<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p7.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p7.1"><sup class="Note">466</sup></a> claim that it faithfully
reflects the subapostolic period in the rural churches of Syria.

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.i-Page_164"/>  <strong>{Page 164}</strong> Others<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p7.2" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p7.2"><sup class="Note">467</sup></a> hold that its regulations regarding prophets betray its
Montanist origin. A third opinion<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p7.3" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p7.3"><sup class="Note">468</sup></a> is that the Didache is an
artificial composition, aimed to recall the second century
Church to greater simplicity by reconstructing an imaginative
picture of primitive Christianity from apostolic sources. This
third view is most unlikely. Second century literature was never
purely antiquarian in mode or interest. Its reconstructions of
primitive times were directed toward giving apostolic warrant
to newer ideas and customs. It is the absence from the Didache
of such familiar themes as virginity, episcopacy, Gnostic and
anti-Gnostic tendencies, which needs explaining.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p8">The claim that the Didache is a Montanist tract has more to
be said for it. Yet this view, too, is hardly tenable. The most
characteristic Montanist features are lacking from the Teaching.
It reflects nothing of Montanus and his prophetesses, of
the ascetic rigor of that movement, of the high place accorded
women, of the lively eschatology in connection with Pepuza, or
of the opposition to second marriages and second repentance.
On all these questions the Didache is silent. This disturbing
fact has to be met by the further assumption that all clear
traces of the New Prophecy were purposely suppressed in the
interests of showing “how respectable and apostolic Montanism
could be.” This is, in short, an admission that the Teaching
is not really Montanist.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p8.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p8.1"><sup class="Note">469</sup></a></p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p9">It is, then, to the first view that we are driven. While it is
not without difficulties, it is less unlikely than the others. Some
of these difficulties, moreover, can be removed if we do not
follow the general assumption that the Didachist wrote this
section of the tract himself. It is much more plausible to
suppose that he was a compiler, rather than an author; and
that, just as he made use of the “Two Ways” at the beginning,
so in the second part of his work he utilized an early source
for his Church Order. That would explain why his tract has
such a curious appearance. Onto the catechism he has sewn
some genuinely primitive regulations about Church life. The
effect is very odd, for he implies that the moral catechism
sufficed for baptismal instruction (ch. 7:1), which is, of course,

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.i-Page_165"/>  <strong>{Page 165}</strong> contrary to all we know of early Christianity. Only a scribe
with a limited number of sources at hand could have left such
an impression. He did, indeed, try to rectify things a little by
adding the gospel precepts. But that was the best he could do
under the circumstances. It is not possible to tell how much of
the Church Order he has faithfully preserved or how much he
has altered. Yet his method of handling the “Two Ways” suggests that he would be more likely to make insertions
en bloc than to change his source radically.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p10">We should assume, then, that some scribe in Alexandria about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="viii.i.i-p10.2"/>A.D.</span> 150 edited two ancient documents which came into
his hands. One was the “Two Ways”; the other was a late
first century set of regulations about Church life. He made
some changes in them—how many we shall never know. He
certainly added a section of sayings to the “Two Ways” and
probably composed the final ch. 16, which is only loosely
related to the rest of the document. It is noteworthy that an
interest in perfection appears in these two places (chs. 1:4;
16:2) and in one other—at the junction of the two sources
(ch. 6:2). It seems a mark of the Didachist. Moreover, it is
only in his addition to the catechism and in ch. 16 that a wide
knowledge of New Testament Scripture is evident. In these
two places he conflates Matthew with Luke and cites, among
other things, Barnabas and Hermas. The rest of the work reveals
only a knowledge of Matthew’s Gospel.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p11">The Didache, thus, is the first of those fictitious Church
Orders which edit ancient material and claim apostolic authorship. As in many such instances (e.g., the Apostolic Church
Order, the Apostolic Constitutions, the Testament of Our
Lord), we cannot be sure precisely what is original and what
is edited. Nor do the various regulations necessarily apply to
the time of the compilation. Sometimes a scribe will brush up
ancient material sufficiently to make it appear relevant to his
period. More often he will change it only a little, leaving a
curious combination of the ancient and the modern, which is
bewildering. Hence a degree of caution is needed in citing the Didache as a witness to first century customs. Yet the main
outlines of its arrangements for Church life do seem to reflect
the end of the first century before the monepiscopate had finally
triumphed and while the gift of prophecy was still exercised
(chs. 11; 13). Moreover, the Eucharistic prayers (chs. 9; 10),<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p11.5" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p11.5"><sup class="Note">470</sup></a>

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.i-Page_166"/>  <strong>{Page 166}</strong> so clearly modeled on the Jewish forms for grace before and
after meals, betray a period when the Lord’s Supper was still
a real supper, and when the joyful and expectant note of the
Messianic Banquet had not yet been obscured by the more
solemn emphasis on the Lord’s Passion.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p12">To compile such a document must have been a congenial
task for an Alexandrine scribe who adhered to the small
Catholic minority in that city. Surrounded as he was by every
novelty of Gnostic speculation, he would doubtless take a
special delight in preserving the records of antiquity.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.i-p13">That the source of the Didache’s Church Order (chs. 6:3 to 15)
belongs to Syria and comes from the late first century may be
gathered from several factors. It is clearly dependent upon Matthew’s Gospel and so cannot be earlier than <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="viii.i.i-p13.3"/>A.D.</span> 90. This Gospel, it may be noted, probably comes from Syria. The
Eucharistic prayers reflect an area where wheat is sown on the
hillsides (ch. 9:4), and the baptismal section presupposes a
vicinity where warm baths are prevalent (ch. 7:2). All these
points bespeak Syria, though the Eucharistic prayers themselves may be Judean in origin. The prophets and teachers
(chs. 11 and 13) forcibly recall the situation in Antioch where,
according to <a class="scripRef" id="viii.i.i-p13.5">Acts 13:1</a>, the Church leaders were so named.
We may remind ourselves that the author of The Acts is always
careful about his titles.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p13.6" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p13.6"><sup class="Note">471</sup></a> The picture we gain from this source
of the Didache is one of rural communities<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.i-p13.15" href="#fnf_viii.i.i-p13.15"><sup class="Note">472</sup></a> periodically enjoying a visitation from the leaders of some Christian center.
Indeed, a city like Antioch may well have been responsible
for this primitive manual to guide the rural churches.</p>

      <h3 id="viii.i.ii-p0.1">MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS</h3>
      <h4 id="viii.i.ii-p0.2">Manuscripts</h4>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p1">Only one Greek text of the Didache has survived. It is the
Jerusalem Codex discovered by Byrennios in 1873, and published
by him in Constantinople ten years later. It was written
by a scribe, Leo, in 1056. A photographic facsimile was published
by J. Rendel Harris in 1887.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p2">Two papyrus fragments of the Didache in Greek (chs. 1:3, 4
and 2:7 to 3:2) were edited by A. S. Hunt in
<i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri,</i> 15, London, 1922, pp. 12–15.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p3">The Greek texts of the Epistle of Barnabas (chs. 18 to 20)
and of the Apostolic Church Order (chs. 1 to 13) contain the
“Two Ways” material in different forms. In the latter case
there are many additions, and dependence on the “Two Ways”
breaks off at the equivalent of Did. 4:8. The Greek text of the
Apostolic Constitutions (ch. 7:1–32) contains almost the whole
of the Didache with a number of changes and many insertions.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p4">In Syriac there are citations from the Didache in the Didascalia,
edited by R. H. Connolly, Oxford University Press,
London, 1929.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p5">In Latin there is a third century translation of the “Two
Ways.” A fragment was published by B. Pez in 1723. The complete
text was edited from an eleventh century manuscript
by J. Schlecht, <i>Doctrina XII Apostolorum,</i> Freiburg, 1900.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p6">In Coptic there is a fifth century papyrus fragment of chs.
10:3b to 12:2a, edited by G. Horner in
<i>The Journal of Theological Studies,</i> 25, 1924, pp. 225–231. (It is notable for adding
after the Eucharistic prayer a thanksgiving for myron, holy oil
for confirmation.)</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p7">In Arabic the “Two Ways” material is found in the fifth
century <i>Life of Schnudi.</i> A German rendering is given by L. E.

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.ii-Page_168"/>  <strong>{Page 168}</strong> Iselin and A. Heusler in Texte und Untersuchungen, XIII, 1b, pp. 6–10, 1895.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p8">In Ethiopic the following parts of the Didache have been
preserved in the Ecclesiastical Canons: chs. II:3–5, 7–11, 12;
12:1–5; 13:1, 3–7; 8:1, 2a, in that order. They are edited by G.
Horner, <i>Statutes of the Apostles</i>, pp. 193, 194, London, 1904.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p9">In Georgian there is a complete translation made in the fifth
century by a scribe, Jeremias of Orhai. The variant readings
were published by G. Peradze in <i>Zeitschrift für die neutestamentliche
Wissenschaft</i>, pp. 111–116, 1932, from a copy of an eleventh
century manuscript in Constantinople.</p>
      <h4 id="viii.i.ii-p9.1">Books and Articles</h4>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p10">The best Greek text, making use of all the available witnesses,
is by Theodorus Klauser, <i>Doctrina Duodecim Apostolorum: Barnabae
Epistula</i>, “Florilegium Patristicum,” I, Bonn, 1940. It
has been used for this translation. Also of importance are the
texts in K. Bihlmeyer, <i>Die apostolischen Väter</i>, Tübingen, 1924
(note his treatment of the Coptic evidence pp. xviii–xx), in
K. Lake, <i>The Apostolic Fathers</i>, London, 1912, and in H.
Hemmer, G. Oger, and A. Lamont, <i>Les Pères apostoliques</i>, Vol.
I, Paris, 1907 (based on the text of F. X. Funk, <i>Patres apostolici</i>,
Tübingen, 1901).</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p11">Older editions of the Didache, which contain a number of
the related documents along with the text of Byrennios, are
by A. Harnack, <i>Die Lehre der Zwölf Apostel</i>, Texte und Untersuchungen,
II, Leipzig, 1884 (a pioneer and monumental work
which includes the Greek text of the A. C. O. and the relevant
parts of A. C. 7); and by Philip Schaff, <i>The Oldest Church Manual
Called the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i>, New York, 1885
(includes the pertinent sections from Barnabas, Hermas,
A. C. O., and A. C. 7).</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p12">In addition to the works of Schaff and Lake mentioned
above, the following translations in English may be noted: C.
Bigg, <i>The Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles</i> (revised by A. J.
Maclean), London, 1922; F. X. Glimm, <i>The Apostolic Fathers</i>,
in the series The Fathers of the Church, Cima Publishing
Company, New York, 1947; J. A. Kleist, <i>The Didache, The
Epistle of Barnabas</i>, etc., in the series Ancient Christian Writers,
Newman Press, Westminster, Maryland, 1948; and E. Goodspeed,
<i>The Apostolic Fathers: An American Translation</i>, New York, 1950.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="viii.i.ii-Page_169"/>  <strong>{Page 169}</strong> 
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p13">In German there are renderings by F. Zeller, <i>Die apostolischen
Väter,</i> Munich, 1918, in the 2d series of the Bibliothek der
Kirchenväter; by R. Knopf, <i>Die Lehre der Zwölf Apostel: Die
zwei Clemensbriefe, </i>Tübingen, 1920, in Handbuch zum N. T.;
and by E. Hennecke, <i>Neutestamentliche Apocryphen,</i> 2d edition,
Tübingen, 1924.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p14">In French there is the translation by Hemmer, Oger, and
Lamont already mentioned.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p15">In Italian there are renderings by M. dal Pra, <i>La Didache,</i>
Venice, 1938; and by G. Bosio, <i>I Padri apostolici,</i> Part I, Turin,
1940, in the series Corona Patrum Salesiana.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p16">All these editions have introductions and notes. The most
significant are by Harnack, Schaff, Hemmer, Bigg, Kleist,
and Knopf. While Klauser’s introduction and notes (in Latin)
are most concise, they are no less important.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p17">Studies in the Didache are extremely numerous. Of special
importance are the following books: C. Taylor, <i>The Teaching
of the Twelve Apostles with Illustrations from the Talmud,</i>
Cambridge, 1886; J. A. Robinson, <i>Barnabas, Hermas, and the Didache,</i>
London, 1920 (a revision of chs. 1 and 3 was published posthumously
with a preface by R. H. Connolly in <i>The Journal
of Theological Studies,</i> 1934, pp. 113–146, 225–248); J. Muilenburg,
<i>The Literary Relations of the Epistle of Barnabas and the Teaching
of the Twelve Apostles,</i> Ph.D. thesis, Marburg, 1929; F. E.
Vokes, <i>The Riddle of the Didache,</i> S.P.C.K., London, 1938.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.ii-p18">For many years debate about the Didache has been carried
on in <i>The Journal of Theological Studies.</i> The following articles
are noteworthy: J. V. Bartlet, “The Didache Reconsidered,”
1921, pp. 239–249; R. H. Connolly, “The Use of the Didache
in the Didascalia,” 1923, pp. 147–157; F. R. M. Hitchcock,

      <p id="viii.i.iii-p3">The Lord’s Teaching to the Heathen by the Twelve Apostles:</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p4"><b>1</b> There are two ways, one of life and one of death; and between
the two ways there is a great difference.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p5"><sup>2</sup>Now, this is the way of life: “First, you must love God who
made you, and second, your neighbor as yourself.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p5.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">473</sup></a> And whatever you want people to refrain from doing to you, you
must not do to them.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p5.4" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p5.4"><sup class="Note">474</sup></a></p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p6"><sup>3</sup>What these maxims teach is this: “Bless those who curse you,”
and “pray for your enemies.” Moreover, fast “for those who
persecute you.” For “what credit is it to you if you love those
who love you? Is that not the way the heathen act?” But “you
must love those who hate you,”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">475</sup></a> and then you will make no enemies.
 <sup>4</sup>“Abstain from carnal passions.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.4" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.4"><sup class="Note">476</sup></a> If someone strikes
you “on the right cheek, turn to him the other too, and you
will be perfect.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.6" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.6"><sup class="Note">477</sup></a> If someone “forces you to go one mile with
him, go along with him for two”; if someone robs you “of your
overcoat, give him your suit as well.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.9" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.9"><sup class="Note">478</sup></a> If someone deprives you of “your property, do not ask for it back.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.11" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.11"><sup class="Note">479</sup></a> (You could
not get it back anyway!)
 <sup>5</sup>“Give to everybody who begs from
you, and ask for no return.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.13" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.13"><sup class="Note">480</sup></a> For the Father wants his own
gifts to be universally shared. Happy is the man who gives as
the commandment bids him, for he is guiltless! But alas for
the man who receives! If he receives because he is in need, he
will be guiltless. But if he is not in need he will have to stand
trial why he received and for what purpose. He will be thrown

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.iii-Page_172"/>  <strong>{Page 172}</strong> into prison and have his action investigated; and “he will not
get out until he has paid back the last cent.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.14" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.14"><sup class="Note">481</sup></a>
 <sup>6</sup> Indeed, there is a further saying that relates to this: “Let your donation sweat
in your hands until you know to whom to give it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p6.16" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p6.16"><sup class="Note">482</sup></a></p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p7"><b>2</b> The second commandment of the Teaching:
 <sup>2</sup>“Do not
murder; do not commit adultery”; do not corrupt boys; do
not fornicate; “do not steal”; do not practice magic; do not go
in for sorcery; do not murder a child by abortion or kill a new-born
infant. “Do not covet your neighbor’s property;
 <sup>3</sup>do not commit perjury; do not bear false witness”;<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p7.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p7.1"><sup class="Note">483</sup></a> do not slander; do not bear grudges.
 <sup>4</sup>Do not be double-minded or double-tongued, for a double tongue is “a deadly snare.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p7.5" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p7.5"><sup class="Note">484</sup></a>
 <sup>5</sup>Your words shall not be dishonest or hollow, but substantiated by action.
 <sup>6</sup> Do not be greedy or extortionate or hypocritical or malicious or arrogant. Do not plot against your neighbor.
 <sup>7</sup> Do not hate anybody; but reprove some, pray for others, and
still others love more than your own life.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p8"><b>3</b> My child, flee from all wickedness and from everything of that sort.
 <sup>2</sup>Do not be irritable, for anger leads to murder. Do not
be jealous or contentious or impetuous, for all this breeds
murder.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p9"><sup>3</sup>My child, do not be lustful, for lust leads to fornication. Do
not use foul language or leer, for all this breeds adultery.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p10"><sup>4</sup>My child, do not be a diviner, for that leads to idolatry. Do
not be an enchanter or an astrologer or a magician. Moreover,
have no wish to observe or heed such practices, for all this
breeds idolatry.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p11"><sup>5</sup>My child, do not be a liar, for lying leads to theft. Do not be
avaricious or vain, for all this breeds thievery.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p12"><sup>6</sup>My child, do not be a grumbler, for grumbling leads to
blasphemy. Do not be stubborn or evil-minded, for all this breeds blasphemy.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p13"><sup>7</sup>But be humble since “the humble will inherit the earth.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p13.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p13.1"><sup class="Note">485</sup></a>
 <sup>8</sup> Be patient, merciful, harmless, quiet, and good; and always
“have respect for the teaching”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p13.4" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p13.4"><sup class="Note">486</sup></a> you have been given. Do not
put on airs or give yourself up to presumptuousness. Do not
associate with the high and mighty; but be with the upright
and humble. Accept whatever happens to you as good, in the
realization that nothing occurs apart from God.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="viii.i.iii-Page_173"/>  <strong>{Page 173}</strong> 
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p14"><b>4</b> My child, day and night “you should remember him who
preaches God’s word to you,”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p14.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">487</sup></a> and honor him as you would
the Lord. For where the Lord’s nature is discussed, there the Lord is.
 <sup>2</sup>Every day you should seek the company of saints to enjoy their refreshing conversation.
 <sup>3</sup>You must not start a schism, but reconcile those at strife. “Your judgments must be
fair.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p14.3" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p14.3"><sup class="Note">488</sup></a> You must not play favorites when reproving transgressions.

      <p id="viii.i.iii-p15"><sup>5</sup>Do not be one who holds his hand out to take, but shuts it when it comes to giving.
 <sup>6</sup>If your labor has brought you earnings, pay a ransom for your sins.
 <sup>7</sup>Do not hesitate to give and do not
give with a bad grace; for you will discover who He is that pays you back a reward with a good grace.
 <sup>8</sup>Do not turn your back on the needy, but share everything with your brother and call
nothing your own. For if you have what is eternal in common,
how much more should you have what is transient!</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p16"><sup>9</sup>Do not neglect your responsibility<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p16.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">490</sup></a> to your son or your
daughter, but from their youth you shall teach them to revere God.
 <sup>10</sup>Do not be harsh in giving orders to your slaves and slave
girls. They hope in the same God as you, and the result may be that they cease to revere the God over you both. For when
he comes to call us, he will not respect our station, but will call those whom the Spirit has made ready.
 <sup>11</sup>You slaves, for your part, must obey your masters with reverence and fear,
as if they represented God.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p17"><sup>12</sup>You must hate all hypocrisy and everything which fails to please the Lord.
 <sup>13</sup>You must not forsake “the Lord’s commandments,”
but “observe” the ones you have been given, “neither
adding nor subtracting anything.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p17.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p17.1"><sup class="Note">491</sup></a>
 <sup>14</sup>At the church meeting
you must confess your sins, and not approach prayer with a bad
conscience. That is the way of life.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p18"><b>5</b> But the way of death is this: First of all, it is wicked and
thoroughly blasphemous: murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications,
thefts, idolatries, magic arts, sorceries, robberies, false
witness, hypocrisies, duplicity, deceit, arrogance, malice,
stubbornness, greediness, filthy talk, jealousy, audacity,
haughtiness, boastfulness.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p18.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p18.1"><sup class="Note">492</sup></a></p>

“abide by goodness”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p19.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p19.1"><sup class="Note">493</sup></a> or justice, and are on the alert not for

away from what is offered to idols, for that implies worshiping
dead gods.</p>

thanks in their own way.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p44.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p44.1"><sup class="Note">518</sup></a></p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p45"><b>11</b> Now, you should welcome anyone who comes your way and teaches you all we have been saying.
 <sup>2</sup> But if the teacher proves himself a renegade and by teaching otherwise contradicts all
this, pay no attention to him. But if his teaching furthers the
Lord’s righteousness and knowledge, welcome him as the Lord.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p46"><sup>3</sup>Now about the apostles and prophets: Act in line with the
gospel precept.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p46.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p46.1"><sup class="Note">519</sup></a>
 <sup>4</sup>Welcome every apostle on arriving, as if he were the Lord.
 <sup>5</sup>But he must not stay beyond one day. In case
of necessity, however, the next day too. If he stays three days, he is a false prophet.
 <sup>6</sup>On departing, an apostle must not accept anything save sufficient food to carry him till his next lodging.
If he asks for money, he is a false prophet.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p47"><sup>7</sup>While a prophet is making ecstatic utterances,<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p47.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p47.1"><sup class="Note">520</sup></a> you must
not test or examine him. For “every sin will be forgiven,”
but this sin “will not be forgiven.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p47.5" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p47.5"><sup class="Note">521</sup></a>
 <sup>8</sup>However, not everybody

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.iii-Page_177"/>  <strong>{Page 177}</strong> making ecstatic utterances is a prophet, but only if he behaves
like the Lord. It is by their conduct that the false prophet and
the [true] prophet can be distinguished.
 <sup>9</sup>For instance, if a prophet
marks out a table in the Spirit,<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p47.7" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p47.7"><sup class="Note">522</sup></a> he must not eat from it. If he
does, he is a false prophet.
 <sup>10</sup>Again, every prophet who teaches the truth but fails to practice what he preaches is a false prophet.
 <sup>11</sup>But every attested and genuine prophet who acts
with a view to symbolizing the mystery of the Church,<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p47.10" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p47.10"><sup class="Note">523</sup></a> and
does not teach you to do all he does, must not be judged by
you. His judgment rests with God. For the ancient prophets too acted in this way.
 <sup>12</sup>But if someone says in the Spirit, “Give
me money, or something else,” you must not heed him. However,
if he tells you to give for others in need, no one must
condemn him.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p48"><b>12</b> Everyone “who comes” to you “in the name of the Lord”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p48.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p48.1"><sup class="Note">524</sup></a> must be welcomed. Afterward, when you have tested him, you
will find out about him, for you have insight into right and wrong.
 <sup>2</sup>If it is a traveler who arrives, help him all you can.
But he must not stay with you more than two days, or, if necessary, three.
 <sup>3</sup>If he wants to settle with you and is an artisan, he must work for his living.
 <sup>4</sup>If, however, he has no trade, use your judgment in taking steps for him to live with you as a Christian without being idle.
 <sup>5</sup>If he refuses to do this, he is trading on
Christ. You must be on your guard against such people.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p49"><b>13</b> Every genuine prophet who wants to settle with you “has a right to his support.”
 <sup>2</sup>Similarly, a genuine teacher himself, just
like a “workman, has a right to his support.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p49.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p49.1"><sup class="Note">525</sup></a>
 <sup>3</sup>Hence take all
the first fruits of vintage and harvest, and of cattle and sheep,
and give these first fruits to the prophets. For they are your
high priests.
 <sup>4</sup>If, however, you have no prophet, give them to

<span class="pb" id="viii.i.iii-Page_178"/>  <strong>{Page 178}</strong> the poor.
 <sup>5</sup>If you make bread, take the first fruits and give in
accordance with the precept.<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p49.3" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p49.3"><sup class="Note">526</sup></a>
 <sup>6</sup>Similarly, when you open a jar of wine or oil, take the first fruits and give them to the prophets.
 <sup>7</sup>Indeed, of money, clothes, and of all your possessions,
take such first fruits as you think right, and give in accordance
with the precept.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p50"><b>14</b> On every Lord’s Day—his special day<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p50.1" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p50.1"><sup class="Note">527</sup></a>—come together and
break bread and give thanks, first confessing your sins so that your sacrifice may be pure.
 <sup>2</sup>Anyone at variance with his neighbor must not join you, until they are reconciled, lest your sacrifice
be defiled.
 <sup>3</sup>For it was of this sacrifice that the Lord said,
“Always and everywhere offer me a pure sacrifice; for I am a

nations.”<a class="Note" id="fna_viii.i.iii-p50.2" href="#fnf_viii.i.iii-p50.2"><sup class="Note">528</sup></a></p>

 <sup>2</sup>You must not, therefore,
despise them, for along with the prophets and teachers they
enjoy a place of honor among you.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p52"><sup>3</sup>Furthermore, do not reprove each other angrily, but quietly,
as you find it in the gospel. Moreover, if anyone has wronged
his neighbor, nobody must speak to him, and he must not hear a word from you, until he repents.
 <sup>4</sup>Say your prayers, give your charity, and do everything just as you find it in the gospel of our Lord.</p>
      <p id="viii.i.iii-p53"><b>16</b> “Watch” over your life: do not let “your lamps” go out, and
do not keep “your loins ungirded”; but “be ready,” for “you

 <sup>3</sup>For in the final
days multitudes of false prophets and seducers will appear.

increase of iniquity men will hate, persecute, and betray each
other. And then the world deceiver will appear in the guise of

        <i>An Anonymous Sermon, Commonly Called Clement’s Second Letter to the Corinthians</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="ix.i.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p1"><span class="sc">The document that goes under this misleading</span>
name is neither a letter nor a genuine work of Clement
of Rome. It is an anonymous Christian sermon—the
earliest that has come down to us. It was written at some time
before the middle of the second century; and while scholars
differ widely on its place of origin, there are a number of indications
that it stems from Egypt. Its importance lies in the picture
it gives us of early Christian preaching.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p2">Here is a homily that some presbyter<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p2.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p2.1"><sup class="Note">539</sup></a> has written out with a
view to reading it to a congregation immediately after the
Scripture lesson (ch. 19:1). It is simple, direct, and without
any claim to style or clear organization. Taking a verse from
the lection (<a class="scripRef" id="ix.i.i-p2.2">Isa. 54:1</a>), the preacher briefly expounds it and
passes on to exhort his hearers to a life of moral purity and
steadfastness in persecution, emphasizing the need to repent
in the light of the coming judgment. He is addressing Gentile
converts (chs, 1:6; 3:1; 17:3), who are in danger of falling a
prey to Gnostic teachings (ch. 10:5). In consequence, he stresses
the divinity of Christ (ch. 1:1), the resurrection of the flesh
(ch. 9), and the way in which the Church is the continuity of
the incarnation (ch. 14). These theological emphases are sometimes
tinged with Gnostic speculation (chs. 12; 14), but they
are nonetheless aimed against basic Gnostic tenets which saw
in Christ a being intermediary between God and man, and
denied the significance of the body. By holding that the material
world was the creation of an evil or impotent god who was
contrasted with the good God revealed in Christ, these Gnostics

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.i-Page_184"/>  <strong>{Page 184}</strong> rejected the reality of the incarnation and indulged in a moral
antinomianism, on the grounds that bodily life was inherently
evil. Against such views our sermon is directed.</p>
      <h4 id="ix.i.i-p2.3">The Origin  of the Homily</h4>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p3">How this homily ever came to be associated with Clement’s
name and dubbed his Second Letter is something of a riddle.
This had, however, occurred as early as Eusebius’ time, for
he mentions the fact that a second letter is ascribed to Clement,
though he rejects it as unauthentic on the grounds that it is
not cited by early writers.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p3.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p3.1"><sup class="Note">540</sup></a> Yet the sermon was held in high
esteem in some areas of the Church, for it forms part of the New
Testament canon in two manuscripts that have survived. In
the Codex Alexandrinus (fifth century) it comes at the close
of the New Testament after Clement’s genuine Letter; while in
a Syrian manuscript of the twelfth century the two Letters of
Clement are inserted between the Catholic Epistles and the
Epistles of Paul. Furthermore, the <i>Apostolic Canons</i> (a work
emanating from Syria in the late fourth century) list Clement’s
two Letters as part of the New Testament (canon 85). It is
first in Severus of Antioch<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p3.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p3.2"><sup class="Note">541</sup></a> (sixth century) that the destination
of the Second Letter to the Corinthians is made clear, though a
century earlier this is probably assumed by Pseudo-Justin.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p3.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p3.4"><sup class="Note">542</sup></a></p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p4">Somehow or other our sermon became attached to Clement’s
genuine Letter. This must have happened by the middle of
the second century, for by <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="ix.i.i-p4.1"/>A.D.</span> 180 the New Testament canon
was sufficiently settled not to have admitted such an intruder.
Indeed, it is not impossible that Irenaeus<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p4.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p4.2"><sup class="Note">543</sup></a> knew of the homily as an addendum to Clement’s Letter to the Corinthians. For in
listing the contents of that work he introduces one doctrine—that of the fiery judgment—that is notably absent from it,
but that plays a significant role in our sermon (chs. 16:3; 17:7).
Strangely enough, this same doctrine is also attributed by
Pseudo-Justin to Clement’s Letter to the Corinthians.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p5">Various attempts have been made to explain this situation.
It is sometimes argued that the confusion could have originated
only in Corinth. It was that church which possessed Clement’s
genuine Letter, and from time to time read it at worship on

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.i-Page_185"/>  <strong>{Page 185}</strong> Sundays.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p5.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p5.1"><sup class="Note">544</sup></a> What could be more likely than that some treasured
but anonymous homily of that church should be bound up
with Clement’s Letter, and so become a part of the lectionary
manuscript? Furthermore, it is claimed that one reference in our
sermon makes it very clear that it stems from Corinth. In ch. 7
the preacher compares the Christian life to the Greek games,
and even mentions the fact that the athletes “come by sea” to
participate (ch. 7:1). Is this not a decisive indication that the
local Isthmian games are in his mind?<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p5.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p5.2"><sup class="Note">545</sup></a> The word <i>katapleō</i>
literally means “sail to the shore,” and it would appear that
the preacher was thinking of the crowds landing on the Corinthian Isthmus.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p6">Against this view two objections can be raised. For one thing,
Corinth was not the only place where Clement’s genuine Letter
was prized or read in worship. Alexandria was another; for
Clement of Alexandria several times cites it as Scripture,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p6.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p6.1"><sup class="Note">546</sup></a> apparently viewing it as an apostolic writing and identifying its
author with the Clement in <a class="scripRef" id="ix.i.i-p6.3">Phil. 4:3</a>. It is just as likely that
Alexandria should be the source of the confusion as Corinth.
Moreover, the reference to the games in ch. 7 cannot be unduly
pressed. The verb <i>katapleō</i> can be used in a derived sense,
meaning little more than “resort to”; and the popularity of
the Isthmian games was matched by that of those in other
centers. Indeed, there were important games held in Alexandria.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p7">Another theory, originally put forward by Hilgenfeld,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p7.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p7.1"><sup class="Note">547</sup></a> has won a good deal of acceptance, due to its elaboration by Harnack.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p7.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p7.2"><sup class="Note">548</sup></a> More recently it has been defended by Goodspeed.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p7.3" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p7.3"><sup class="Note">549</sup></a> It is contended that our homily is the lost letter that
Bishop Soter of Rome (<span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="ix.i.i-p7.4"/>A.D.</span> 166–174) wrote to the church of
Corinth. This letter, as we learn from the reply by the bishop
of Corinth, Dionysius,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p7.5" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p7.5"><sup class="Note">550</sup></a> was much valued, and read in public

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.i-Page_186"/>  <strong>{Page 186}</strong> worship. There are two slight indications that our sermon
comes from Rome. One is the curious use of a lost apocalypse
(possibly that of Eldad and Modat, mentioned in Hermas,
Vis. II. 3:4) by both Clement of Rome (ch. 23:3, 4) and our
homily (ch. 11:2–4). The other is the similarity of our work,
in its stress on repentance and the end of the world, to the
Roman Shepherd of Hermas itself.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p8">The difficulties, however, of this thesis are insuperable. A
sermon is not a letter; and there could be nothing more foreign
to Roman Christianity of <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="ix.i.i-p8.1"/>A.D.</span> 170 than the tone of our homily.
Its semi-Gnostic phrases, despite its attack on Gnostic ideas;
its speculative spirit; its lack of mention of the monepiscopate,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p8.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p8.2"><sup class="Note">551</sup></a> of the Logos Christology, and of tradition—all these factors
tell against its Roman origin. Even more decisive is its use of
an apocryphal gospel—the Gospel of the Egyptians—of which
more will be said later. Here we may merely note that Hippolytus,
who embodied the distinctively Roman tradition and who
lived so near to Soter’s time, viewed that gospel as quite
heretical.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p8.3" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p8.3"><sup class="Note">552</sup></a> It is surely incredible that at a time when the fourfold
gospel had triumphed, a Roman bishop should have relied
on an apocryphal one for three or more citations! Then again,
Dionysius does not say that Soter sent a homily with a covering
letter—which we must assume on this theory. He says Soter
sent a letter; and by no stretch of the imagination can our
document be called that. Furthermore, the alleged similarities
of our homily with the Shepherd of Hermas are not very persuasive.
It is rather the marked differences between the two
works that are striking. Hermas, for example, insists that only
one repentance after baptism is permissible; our preacher
mentions no such limit. Again, Hermas’ Christology is tinged
with adoptionism, while our author thinks in terms of preexistent
spirit becoming incarnate. Finally, while both Clement’s
genuine Letter and our homily use some lost apocalypse,
we are not forced to assume that Rome was the only place
where this document was current.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p9">The only situation that really fits the temper and tone of our
sermon is Alexandria. This was perceived and worked out by
Vernon Bartlet as early as 1906;<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p9.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p9.1"><sup class="Note">553</sup></a> and Streeter, quite independently, arrived at the same conclusion some twenty years later.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p9.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p9.2"><sup class="Note">554</sup></a> The church of Alexandria was the fountainhead of

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.i-Page_187"/>  <strong>{Page 187}</strong> Gnostic speculation; and even the orthodox in that center
cannot have been unaffected by its spirit. The strong Platonic
note that underlies the discussion of the pre-existent Church in
ch. 14 is thoroughly Alexandrine, and reflects the world of
thought out of which Valentinus developed his “aeons.” Then
again, our preacher relies on an apocryphal gospel which (so
far as we know) was in use only in Alexandria, and which
itself shows Gnostic traces (cf. the citation in ch. 12:2). It is
the Gospel of the Egyptians, some fragments of which have
been preserved by Clement of Alexandria.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p9.3" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p9.3"><sup class="Note">555</sup></a> The logion in
ch. 12:2 comes from that gospel (see note <i>ad loc</i>.), and we may
assume that other sayings not to be found in our Gospels
(chs. 4:5; 5:2–4) are similarly derived from it. Since, too, it is
likely that this Egyptian gospel was a second century product
based on the Synoptic tradition, other quotations in our sermon
may be drawn from it, rather than from their original sources.
Once more, the manuscript tradition of our homily is entirely
Eastern. No Latin translation of it has turned up, nor does it
seem to have been known in the West. Finally, we may emphasize
the high regard shown by Clement of Alexandria for his
Roman namesake’s genuine Letter. If this could be treated as
Scripture and publicly read in Alexandria, it is just as likely
that the confusion of the documents originated there as in
Corinth. Indeed, in the light of the other factors, it would seem
that some local, anonymous homily was early attached in
Alexandria to a lectionary manuscript that concluded with
Clement’s Letter. Thus our sermon came eventually to be
passed off as his Second Epistle.</p>
      <h4 id="ix.i.i-p9.4">Religious Ideas</h4>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p10">As we have already indicated, the purpose of this homily is
to call the congregation to repentance (chs. 8:2; 9:7, 8; etc.),
to urge them to steadfastness in persecution (chs. 3:1–4; 5;
19:3, 4), and to challenge some basic Gnostic ideas. There is a
stress upon the divinity of Christ (ch. 1:1) and the resurrection
of the flesh (ch. 9). Much is said about Christian purity, about
the need to keep the seal of baptism free from defilement
(chs. 6:9; 7:6), to confess Christ by our actions, and to engage
in acts of charity (ch. 16:4). Such acts, it is pointed out, lighten
the load of sin. This is a characteristic emphasis of the second

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.i-Page_188"/>  <strong>{Page 188}</strong> century where, after the passing of the first enthusiasm of the
faith and in view of Gnostic antinomianism, the need was
always present to stress the moral life and obedience to the
commandments. Hence such un-Pauline phrases occur as:
“Fasting is better than prayer” (ch. 16:4), or, “By giving up
the soul’s wicked passions we shall share in the mercy of Jesus”
(ch. 16:2). The tone of the homily is removed from Paul’s
gospel of faith and justification. The accent falls rather on
repentance and good works.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p11">The urgent note of the old eschatology is still present
(chs. 12:1; 17:4–7), and the day of judgment is already on its
way (ch. 16:3).</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p12">The most notable theological idea, however, in the sermon
is the doctrine of the Church. In a difficult passage (ch. 14),
dependent on the Platonic conception of the phenomenal
world as a copy of the immaterial forms, the author works
out a view of the Church as the continuity of the incarnation,
and connects it with the need for Christian purity. The Church,
he claims, is a pre-existent, spiritual reality which took visible
form in the flesh of Christ, and is similarly manifested in the
flesh of Christians. To abuse the flesh, therefore, is to abuse the
spiritual reality of the Church, the flesh being the copy of the
“spirit.” On the other hand, to keep the flesh pure is to preserve
the Church from defilement. As a result, the Christian
shares in the spiritual reality of the Church, and in return for
giving up his lustful passions, he “gets back,” as it were, a
reward by sharing in “spirit.” The line of thought is not
altogether clear; but the underlying conviction is that the
Church is a spiritual reality manifested in the incarnation and
also in the bodies of true Christians.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p13">Finally, the references to Scripture may be mentioned. This
sermon is remarkable for distinguishing between the two classes
of writings in the Church—the “Bible” and the “Apostles”
(ch. 14:2). The “Bible” (literally, the “books”) refers to the
Septuagint; the “Apostles” are the apostolic writings. Both were
read from in Christian worship, as Justin tells us (Apol. I, ch.
67); and these lections were immediately followed by the
sermon, as our preacher himself indicates (ch. 19:1). By his
time the apostolic writings had been elevated to the status
of “Scripture” beside the Septuagint; for in one place (ch.
2:4) he introduces a Gospel saying (<a class="scripRef" id="ix.i.i-p13.1">Matt. 9:13</a>) by the phrase,
“Another [passage of] Scripture says.” This is the first clear
instance we have of such use of a “New Testament” on a level

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.i-Page_189"/>  <strong>{Page 189}</strong> with the Old.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.i-p13.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.i-p13.2"><sup class="Note">556</sup></a> Our preacher appears familiar with much of
the New Testament as we know it; though some of the supposed
citations are short phrases that cannot be unduly pressed.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.i-p14">To summarize: We have in this document the earliest Christian
sermon that has been preserved. It is likely a product of
the Alexandrine church before the middle of the second
century. It is interesting as indicating the use of an apocryphal
gospel, as evidencing certain Gnostic influences while combating
basically Gnostic ideas, and as developing the view of the
Church as the continuity of the incarnation.</p>

      <h3 id="ix.i.ii-p0.1">MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS</h3>
      <p id="ix.i.ii-p1">The Greek text of our homily was first known only in a defective
form. The fifth century N. T. Codex Alexandrinus includes
it after Clement’s genuine Letter, but the manuscript breaks
off at ch. 12:5a. The sermon has no heading, but in a table of
contents prefixed by the scribe, it is called “Clement’s Second
Letter.” Patrick Young (Junius) edited the first edition from
this Codex in 1633.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.ii-p2">While seventeenth century scholars, such as Henry Dodwell
and J. E. Grabe, had already guessed that our work was a
sermon and not a letter, it was not until 1875 that this was made
plain beyond dispute. In that year Philotheos Byrennios published
the eleventh century Jerusalem Codex. This contained
the whole text of the sermon whose concluding chapters
(chs. 18; 19) make its nature abundantly clear. A few months
later the Syriac version came to light in a twelfth century manuscript
of the New Testament. These are our only authorities
for the text. They are described at length in Lightfoot’s <i>Apostolic
Fathers</i>, Part <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="ix.i.ii-p2.1"/>I</span>, Vol. I, pp. 116 ff.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.ii-p3">The Greek text will be found in the standard editions of the
Apostolic Fathers. The one used for this translation is by K.
Bihlmeyer, <i>Die apostolischen Väter</i>, Part <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="ix.i.ii-p3.1"/>I</span>, Tübingen, 1924.

London, 1890; and by K. Lake, <i>The Apostolic Fathers</i> (Loeb
Classics), Vol. I, London, 1912. The text by H. Hemmer
in Hemmer and Lejay’s <i>Les Pères apostoliques</i>, Part 2, Paris,
1909, is based on F. X. Funk, <i>Patres apostolici</i> of 1901.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.ii-p4">Modern English translations will be found in the editions by
Lightfoot (with introduction and copious notes) and by Lake.

the series The Fathers of the Church and by E. J. Goodspeed
in his <i>The Apostolic Fathers: An American Translation</i>, New York,

      <p id="ix.i.ii-p5">There is a translation into French (with introduction and

pp. 244–253 (Alexandrine thesis), New York, 1929.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.ii-p7">There are a number of studies on the religious views of
II Clement: H. Windisch, “Das Christentum des zweiten

late Judaism), Leipzig, 1921; G. Kr ger, “Bemerkungen zum

Väter neu untersucht</i>, II. <small id="ix.i.ii-p7.1">I</small>, “Die älteste Predigt aus
Rom,” Leiden, 1908, where with more ingenuity than success
he tries to recover an original document behind II Clement.
Another attempt to dispute the literary unity of our homily
will be found in W. Schüssler’s “Ist der zweite Klemensbrief
ein einheitliches Ganzes?” in <i>Zeitschrift für die Kirchengeschichte</i>,
28, pp. 1–13, 1907. Some interesting material has been
gathered by C. Taylor in his article “The Homily of Pseudo-Clement,” in <i>The Journal of Philology</i>, 28, pp. 195–208, 1901. Reference to the doctrine of penance in II Clement will be

      <p id="ix.i.iii-p4"><b> 1</b> Brothers, we ought to think of Jesus Christ as we do of God—as
the “judge of the living and the dead.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p4.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p4.1"><sup class="Note">557</sup></a> And we ought
not to belittle our salvation.  <sup>2</sup>For when we belittle him, we hope
to get but little; and they that listen as to a trifling matter, do wrong.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p4.3" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p4.3"><sup class="Note">558</sup></a> And we too do wrong when we fail to realize whence
and by whom and into what circumstances we were called,
and how much suffering Jesus Christ endured for us.  <sup>3</sup>How,
then, shall we repay him, or what return is worthy of his gift
to us? How many blessings we owe to him!  <sup>4</sup>For he has given us
light; as a Father he has called us sons; he has rescued
us when we were perishing.  <sup>5</sup>How, then, shall we praise him, or
how repay him for what we have received?  <sup>6</sup>Our minds were
impaired; we worshiped stone and wood and gold and silver
and brass, the works of men; and our whole life was nothing
else but death. So when we were wrapped in darkness and our
eyes were full of such mist, by his will we recovered our sight
and put off the cloud which infolded us.  <sup>7</sup>For he took pity on
us and in his tenderness saved us, since he saw our great error
and ruin, and that we had no hope of salvation unless it came
from him.  <sup>8</sup>For he called us when we were nothing, and willed
our existence from nothing.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p5"><b> 2</b> “Rejoice, you who are barren and childless; cry out and
shout, you who were never in labor; for the desolate woman
has many more children than the one with the husband.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p5.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">559</sup></a> When he says, “Rejoice, you who are barren and childless,”<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_194"/>  <strong>{Page 194}</strong> 

he refers to us; for our Church was barren before it was given
children.  <sup>2</sup>And when he says, “Shout, you who were never in
labor,” this is what he means: we should offer our prayers to
God with sincerity, and not lose heart like women in labor.
 <sup>3</sup>And he says, “The desolate woman has many more children
than the one with the husband,” because our people seemed to
be abandoned by God. But now that we believe, we have
become more numerous than those who seemed to have God.
 <sup>4</sup>And another Scripture says, “I did not come to call the
righteous, but sinners.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p5.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p5.4"><sup class="Note">560</sup></a>  <sup>5</sup>This means that those perishing must be
saved.  <sup>6</sup>Yes, a great and wonderful thing it is to support, not
things which are standing, but those which are collapsing.
 <sup>7</sup>Thus it was that the Christ willed to save what was perishing;
and he saved many when he came and called us who were
actually perishing.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p6"><b> 3</b> Seeing, then, that he has had such pity on us, firstly, in that
we who are alive do not sacrifice to dead gods or worship them,
but through him have come to know the Father of truth—what
is knowledge in reference to him, save refusing to deny him
through whom we came to know the Father?  <sup>2</sup>He himself says,
“He who acknowledges me before men, I will acknowledge
before my Father.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p6.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">561</sup></a>  <sup>3</sup>This, then, is our reward, if we acknowledge
him through whom we are saved.  <sup>4</sup>But how do we acknowledge
him? By doing what he says and not disobeying his
commands; by honoring him not only with our lips, but with all
our heart and mind.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p6.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p6.4"><sup class="Note">562</sup></a> And he says in Isaiah as well, “This
people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p6.6" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p6.6"><sup class="Note">563</sup></a></p>

refraining from adultery, backbiting, and jealousy, and by
being self-controlled, compassionate, kind. We ought to have
sympathy for one another and not to be avaricious. Let us
acknowledge him by acting in this way and not by doing the
opposite.  <sup>4</sup>We ought not to have greater fear of men than of
God.  <sup>5</sup>That is why, if you act in this way, the Lord said, “If
you are gathered with me in my bosom and do not keep my<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_195"/>  <strong>{Page 195}</strong> commands, I will cast you out and will say to you: ‘Depart

death the lambs should not fear the wolves, nor should you fear
those who kill you and can do nothing more to you. But fear
him who, when you are dead, has power over soul and body to
cast them into the flames of hell.”
 <sup>5</sup>You must realize, brothers,
that our stay in this world of the flesh is slight and short, but
Christ’s promise is great and wonderful, and means rest in the
coming Kingdom and in eternal life.
 <sup>6</sup>What, then, must we do
to get these things, except to lead a holy and upright life and
to regard these things of the world as alien to us and not to
desire them?
 <sup>7</sup>For in wanting to obtain these things we fall from the right way.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p9"><b> 6</b> The Lord says, “No servant can serve two masters.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p9.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p9.1"><sup class="Note">567</sup></a> If we want to serve both God and money, it will do us no good.

two enemies.
 <sup>4</sup>This one means adultery, corruption, avarice,
and deceit, while the other gives them up.
 <sup>5</sup>We cannot, then, be friends of both. To get the one, we must give the other up.
 <sup>6</sup>We think that it is better to hate what is here, for it is trifling, transitory, and perishable, and to value what is there—things
good and imperishable.
 <sup>7</sup>Yes, if we do the will of Christ, we shall
find rest, but if not, nothing will save us from eternal punishment,
if we fail to heed his commands.
 <sup>8</sup>Furthermore, the Scripture
also says in Ezekiel, “Though Noah and Job and Daniel
should rise, they shall not save their children in captivity.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p9.8" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p9.8"><sup class="Note">569</sup></a>  <sup>9</sup>If even such upright men as these cannot save their children by their uprightness, what assurance have we that we shall

holy and upright deeds?</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p10"><b> 7</b> So, my brothers, let us enter the contest, recognizing that it is at hand and that, while many come by sea to corruptible

contests, not all win laurels, but only those who have struggled
hard and competed well.  <sup>2</sup>Let us, then, compete so that we may
all be crowned.  <sup>3</sup>Let us run the straight race, the incorruptible
contest; and let many of us sail to it and enter it, so that we too
may be crowned. And if we cannot all be crowned, let us at
least come close to it.  <sup>4</sup>We must realize that if a contestant in a
corruptible contest is caught cheating, he is flogged, removed,
and driven from the course.  <sup>5</sup> What do you think? What shall
be done with the man who cheats in the contest for the incorruptible?
 <sup>6</sup>For in reference to those who have not guarded the seal,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p10.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p10.1"><sup class="Note">570</sup></a> it says, “Their worm shall not die and their fire shall

      <p id="ix.i.iii-p11"><b> 8</b> So while we are on earth, let us repent. For we are like clay in
a workman’s hands.  <sup>2</sup>If a potter makes a vessel and it gets out
of shape or breaks in his hands, he molds it over again; but if
he has once thrown it into the flames of the furnace, he can do
nothing more with it. Similarly, while we are in this world,
let us too repent with our whole heart of the evil we have done in
the flesh, so that we may be saved by the Lord while we have a
chance to repent.  <sup>3</sup>For once we have departed this world we
can no longer confess there or repent any more.  <sup>4</sup>Thus, brothers,
by doing the Father’s will and by keeping the flesh pure and by
abiding by the Lord’s commands, we shall obtain eternal life.
 <sup>5</sup>For the Lord says in the Gospel: “If you fail to guard what is
small, who will give you what is great? For I tell you that he
who is faithful in a very little, is faithful also in much.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p11.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p11.1"><sup class="Note">572</sup></a>  <sup>6</sup>This, then, is what he means: keep the flesh pure and the seal
undefiled, so that we may obtain eternal life.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p12"><b> 9</b> Moreover, let none of you say that this flesh will not be
judged or rise again.  <sup>2</sup>Consider this: In what state were you
saved? In what state did you regain your sight, if it was not
while you were in this flesh?  <sup>3</sup>Therefore we should guard the
flesh as God’s temple.  <sup>4</sup>For just as you were called in the flesh,
you will come in the flesh.  <sup>5</sup>If Christ the Lord who saved us was
made flesh though he was at first spirit, and called us in this
way, in the same way we too in this very flesh will receive our
reward.  <sup>6</sup>Let us, then, love one another, so that we may all come
to God’s Kingdom.  <sup>7</sup>While we have an opportunity to be healed,
let us give ourselves over to God, the physician, and pay him
in return.  <sup>8</sup>How? By repenting with a sincere heart.  <sup>9</sup>For he

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_197"/>  <strong>{Page 197}</strong> foreknows everything, and realizes what is in our hearts.  <sup>10</sup>Let
us then praise him, not with the mouth only, but from the heart,
so that he may accept us as sons.  <sup>11</sup>For the Lord said, “My
brothers are those who do the will of my Father.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p12.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p12.1"><sup class="Note">573</sup></a></p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p13"><b> 10</b> So, my brothers, let us do the will of the Father who called us,
so that we may have life; and let our preference be the pursuit
of virtue. Let us give up vice as the forerunner of our sins, and
let us flee impiety, lest evils overtake us.  <sup>2</sup>For if we are eager to
do good, peace will pursue us.  <sup>3</sup>This is the reason men cannot
find peace.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p13.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p13.1"><sup class="Note">574</sup></a> They give way to human fears,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p13.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p13.2"><sup class="Note">575</sup></a> and prefer the pleasures of the present to the promises of the future.
 <sup>4</sup>For they do not realize what great torment the pleasures of the
present bring, and what delight attaches to the promises of the
future.  <sup>5</sup>If they did these things by themselves, it might be
tolerable. But they persist in teaching evil to innocent souls,
and do not realize that they and their followers will have their
sentence doubled.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p14"><b> 11</b> Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart and we shall be
upright. But if, by not believing in God’s promises; we do not
serve him, we shall be wretched.  <sup>2</sup>For the word of the prophet
says, “Wretched are the double-minded, those who doubt in
their soul and say, `We have heard these things long ago, even
in our fathers’ times, and day after day we have waited and
have seen none of them.’  <sup>3</sup>You fools! Compare yourselves to a
tree. Take a vine: first it sheds its leaves, then comes a bud,
and after this a sour grape, then a ripe bunch.  <sup>4</sup>So my people
too has had turmoils and troubles; but after that it will receive
good things.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p14.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">576</sup></a>  <sup>5</sup>So, my brothers, we must not be double-minded.
Rather must we patiently hold out in hope so that we
may also gain our reward.  <sup>6</sup>For “he can be trusted who promised”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p14.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p14.2"><sup class="Note">577</sup></a> to pay each one the wages due for his work.  <sup>7</sup>If, then,
we have done what is right in God’s eyes, we shall enter his
Kingdom and receive the promises “which ear has not heard
or eye seen, or which man’s heart has not entertained.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p14.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p14.4"><sup class="Note">578</sup></a></p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p15"><b> 12</b> Loving and doing what is right, we must be on the watch for
God’s Kingdom hour by hour, since we do not know the day

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_198"/>  <strong>{Page 198}</strong> when God will appear.  <sup>2</sup>For when someone asked the Lord
when his Kingdom was going to come, he said, “When the two
shall be one, and the outside like the inside, and the male with
the female, neither male nor female.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p15.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p15.1"><sup class="Note">579</sup></a>  <sup>3</sup>Now “the two” are
“one” when we tell each other the truth and two bodies
harbor a single mind with no deception.  <sup>4</sup>“The outside
like the inside” means this: “the inside” means the soul
and “the outside” means the body. Just as your body is visible,
so make your soul evident by your good deeds.  <sup>5</sup>Furthermore
“the male with the female, neither male nor female,” means
this: that when a brother sees a sister<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p15.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p15.2"><sup class="Note">580</sup></a> he should not think of
her sex, any more than she should think of his.  <sup>6</sup>When you do
these things, he says, my Father’s Kingdom will come.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p16"><b> 13</b> Right now, my brothers, we must repent, and be alert for
the good, for we are full of much stupidity and wickedness. We
must wipe off from us our former sins and by heartfelt repentance
be saved. And we must not seek to please men or desire
to please only ourselves, but by doing what is right to please
even outsiders, so that the Name<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p16.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">581</sup></a> may not be scoffed at on our
account.  <sup>2</sup>For the Lord says, “My name is continually scoffed at
by all peoples”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p16.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p16.2"><sup class="Note">582</sup></a>;and again, “Alas for him through whom my
name is scoffed at!”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p16.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p16.4"><sup class="Note">583</sup></a> How is it scoffed at? By your failing to do
what I want.  <sup>3</sup>For when the heathen hear God’s oracles on our
lips they marvel at their beauty and greatness. But afterwards,
when they mark that our deeds are unworthy of the words we
utter, they turn from this to scoffing, and say that it is a myth
and a delusion.  <sup>4</sup>When, for instance, they hear from us that God
says, “It is no credit to you if you love those who love you, but
it is to your credit if you love your enemies and those who
hate you,”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p16.5" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p16.5"><sup class="Note">584</sup></a> when they hear these things, they are amazed at
such surpassing goodness. But when they see that we fail to love
not only those who hate us, but even those who love us, then
they mock at us and scoff at the Name.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p17"><b> 14</b> So, my brothers, by doing the will of God our Father we shall
belong to the first Church, the spiritual one, which was created

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_199"/>  <strong>{Page 199}</strong> before the sun and the moon. But if we fail to do the Lord’s
will, that passage of Scripture will apply to us which says, “My
house has become a robber’s den.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.1"><sup class="Note">585</sup></a> So, then, we must choose
to belong to the Church of life in order to be saved.  <sup>2</sup>I do not
suppose that you are ignorant that the living “Church is the
body of Christ.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.4"><sup class="Note">586</sup></a> For Scripture says, “God made man male and female.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.6" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.6"><sup class="Note">587</sup></a> The male is Christ; the female is the Church. The Bible,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.8" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.8"><sup class="Note">588</sup></a> moreover, and the Apostles<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.9" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.9"><sup class="Note">589</sup></a> say that the Church is not limited to the present, but existed from the beginning.
For it was spiritual, as was our Jesus, and was<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.10" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.10"><sup class="Note">590</sup></a> made manifest
in the last days to save us.  <sup>3</sup>Indeed, the Church which is spiritual
was made manifest in the flesh of Christ, and so indicates to us
that if any of us guard it in the flesh<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.12" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.12"><sup class="Note">591</sup></a> and do not corrupt it, he will get it in return by the Holy Spirit.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.13" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.13"><sup class="Note">592</sup></a> For this flesh is the
antitype of the spirit. Consequently, no one who has corrupted
the antitype will share in the reality. This, then, is what it
means, brothers: Guard the flesh so that you may share in the
spirit.  <sup>4</sup>Now, if we say that the Church is the flesh and the
Christ is the spirit, then he who does violence to the flesh,
does violence to the Church. Such a person, then, will not share
in the spirit, which is Christ.  <sup>5</sup>This flesh is able to share in so
great a life and immortality, because the Holy Spirit cleaves
to it. Nor can one express or tell “what things the Lord has prepared”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.14" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.14"><sup class="Note">593</sup></a> for his chosen ones.<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p17.16" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p17.16"><sup class="Note">594</sup></a></p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p18"><b> 15</b> The advice I have given about continence is not, I think,
unimportant; and if a man acts on it, he will not regret it,
but will save himself as well as me who advised him. For no
small reward attaches to converting an errant and perishing
soul, so that it may be saved.  <sup>2</sup>For this is how we can pay back
God who created us, if the one who speaks and the one who

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_200"/>  <strong>{Page 200}</strong> hears do so with faith and love.  <sup>3</sup>Consequently, we must remain
true to our faith and be upright and holy, so that we may petition
God in confidence, who says, “Even while you are speaking,
I will say, ‘See, here I am.’”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p18.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p18.1"><sup class="Note">595</sup></a>  <sup>4</sup>Surely this saying betokens
a great promise; for the Lord says of himself that he is more
ready to give than we to ask.  <sup>5</sup>Let us, then, take our share of
such great kindness and not begrudge ourselves the obtaining
of such great blessings. For these sayings hold as much pleasure

in store for those who act on them, as they do condemnation
for those who disregard them.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p19"><b> 16</b> So, brothers, since we have been given no small opportunity
to repent, let us take the occasion to turn to God who
has called us, while we still have One to accept us.  <sup>2</sup>For if we
renounce these pleasures and master our souls by avoiding
their evil lusts, we shall share in Jesus’ mercy.  <sup>3</sup>Understand that
“the day” of judgment is already “on its way like a furnace ablaze,”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p19.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p19.1"><sup class="Note">596</sup></a> and “the powers<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p19.3" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p19.3"><sup class="Note">597</sup></a> of heaven will dissolve”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p19.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p19.4"><sup class="Note">598</sup></a> and the whole earth will be like lead melting in fire. Then men’s
secret and overt actions will be made clear.  <sup>4</sup>Charity, then, like
repentance from sin, is a good thing. But fasting is better than
prayer, and charity than both. “Love covers a multitude of sins,”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p19.6" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p19.6"><sup class="Note">599</sup></a> and prayer, arising from a good conscience, “rescues from death.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p19.9" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p19.9"><sup class="Note">600</sup></a> Blessed is everyone who abounds in these things, for charity lightens sin.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p20"><b> 17</b> Let us, then, repent with our whole heart, so that none of us
will be lost. For if we have been commanded to do this too—to
draw men away from idols and instruct them—how much
more is it wrong for the soul which already knows God to
perish?  <sup>2</sup>Consequently we must help one another and bring
back those weak in goodness, so that we may all be saved; and
convert and admonish one another.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p21"> <sup>3</sup>Not only at this moment, while the presbyters are preaching
to us, should we appear believing and attentive. But when we
have gone home, we should bear in mind the Lord’s commands
and not be diverted by worldly passions. Rather should we
strive to come here more often and advance in the Lord’s
commands, so that “with a common mind”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p21.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p21.1"><sup class="Note">601</sup></a> we may all be gathered together to gain life.
 <sup>4</sup>For the Lord said, “I am coming
to gather together all peoples, clans, and tongues.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p21.3" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p21.3"><sup class="Note">602</sup></a> This refers
<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_201"/>  <strong>{Page 201}</strong> 

to the day of his appearing, when he will come to redeem us,
each according to his deeds.  <sup>5</sup>And “unbelievers will see his glory”
and power,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p21.5" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p21.5"><sup class="Note">603</sup></a> and they will be surprised to see the sovereignty
of the world given to Jesus, and they will say, “Alas for us,
for you really existed, and we neither recognized it nor believed,
and we did not obey the presbyters who preached to us our
salvation.” And “their worm will not die and their fire will not
be quenched, and they will be a spectacle to all flesh.”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p21.6" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p21.6"><sup class="Note">604</sup></a>  <sup>6</sup>He refers to that day of judgment when men will see those who were
ungodly among us and who perverted the commands of Jesus
Christ.  <sup>7</sup>But the upright who have done good and patiently
endured tortures and hated the pleasures of the soul, when they
see those who have done amiss and denied Jesus in word and
act being punished with dreadful torments and undying fire,
will give “glory to their God”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p21.9" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p21.9"><sup class="Note">605</sup></a> and say, “There is hope for
him who has served God with his whole heart.”</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p22"><b> 18</b> Consequently we too must be of the number of those who
give thanks and have served God, and not of the ungodly
who are sentenced.  <sup>2</sup>For myself, I too am a grave sinner, and
have not yet escaped temptation. I am still surrounded by the
devil’s devices, though I am anxious to pursue righteousness.
My aim is to manage at least to approach it, for I am afraid of
the judgment to come.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p23"><b> 19</b> So, my brothers and sisters, after God’s truth<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p23.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p23.1"><sup class="Note">606</sup></a> I am reading you an exhortation to heed what was there written, so that you
may save yourselves and your reader. For compensation I beg
you to repent with all your heart, granting yourselves salvation
and life. By doing this we will set a goal for all the young
who want to be active in the cause of religion and of God’s
goodness.  <sup>2</sup>We should not, moreover, be so stupid as to be displeased
and vexed when anyone admonishes us and converts us
from wickedness to righteousness. There are times when we do
wrong unconsciously because of the double-mindedness and
unbelief in our hearts, and “our understanding is darkened”<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p23.2" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p23.2"><sup class="Note">607</sup></a> by empty desires.  <sup>3</sup>Let us, then, do what is right so that we may
finally be saved. Blessed are they who observe these injunctions;
though they suffer briefly in this world,<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p23.4" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p23.4"><sup class="Note">608</sup></a> they will gather the immortal fruit of the resurrection.  <sup>4</sup>A religious man must not

<span class="pb" id="ix.i.iii-Page_202"/>  <strong>{Page 202}</strong> be downcast if he is miserable in the present. A time of blessedness
awaits him. He will live again in heaven with his forefathers,
and will rejoice in an eternity that knows no sorrow.</p>
      <p id="ix.i.iii-p24"><b> 20</b> But you must not be troubled in mind by the fact that we see
the wicked in affluence while God’s slaves are in straitened
circumstances.  <sup>2</sup>Brothers and sisters, we must have faith. We are
engaged in the contest of the living God and are being trained
by the present life in order to win laurels in the life to come.
 <sup>3</sup>None of the upright has obtained his reward quickly, but he
waits for it.  <sup>4</sup>For were God to give the righteous their reward
at once, our training would straightway be in commerce and
not in piety, since we would give an appearance of uprightness,
when pursuing, not religion, but gain. That is why the divine
judgment punishes<a class="Note" id="fna_ix.i.iii-p24.1" href="#fnf_ix.i.iii-p24.1"><sup class="Note">609</sup></a> a spirit which is not upright, and loads it with chains.</p>

      <h4 id="x.i.i-p0.2">The History  of the Text</h4>
      <p id="x.i.i-p1"><span class="sc">The so-called</span> <i>Epistula ad Diognetum</i>
<span class="sc">is one of</span>
the most puzzling of ancient documents. While Lightfoot’s
description of it as “the noblest of early Christian writings”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p1.3" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p1.3"><sup class="Note">611</sup></a> expresses the common estimate, there is no agreement
as to its authorship and very little as to its exact date.
The Epistle is unique among patristic works of distinction, in
the fact that we can find no references to it (under its present
title, at least) in the writings of the scholars of the ancient
Church. Moreover, the one MS. (itself medieval) in which it
came to us no longer exists, so that we are dependent on later
transcripts and printed editions for all that we can hope to
know of the work, barring a miracle of discovery.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p2">The unique MS. of the Epistle, <i>Codex Argentoratensis Graecus</i> 9,
containing five treatises ascribed to Justin Martyr, with our
Epistle in fifth place, followed by other contemporary material,
was written in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Its history
is obscure, although it is known, from his annotation on the
back of the codex, that it belonged to the Hebraist Reuchlin
(d. 1522), who had brought it from the charterhouse of his
native town. Apart from a brief appearance about 1560 at the
monastery of Maursmünster in Alsace, it vanishes from sight
until 1793–1795. At that time it came to the municipal library
of Strasbourg (whose ancient name, Argentoratum, gave its
title to the MS.), and remained there until August 24, 1870,
when it was burned during the German attack on the city.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p3">Our knowledge of the MS. comes largely from three sixteenth
century transcripts. The first, which was made by H.

<span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_206"/>  <strong>{Page 206}</strong> Stephanus, of Paris, and served as the basis of the <i>editio princeps</i>
(1592), still exists at Leyden (<i>Codex Graec. Voss.</i>, Q.30). The
second, made c. 1590 by J. J. Beurer, of Freiburg, seems to
have perished, but some of its readings appear in an appendix
to Stephanus’ edition, as well as in the edition of F. Sylburg
(1593). The third copy, made in 1580 by B. Haus, was found
in 1880 at Tübingen (<i>Codex Misc. Tübing.,</i> M.b.17). Most
early editions relied on Stephanus, but the MS. was collated
by E. Cunitz (1842) and E. Reuss (1861) for the first and third
editions respectively of J. C. T. Otto’s <i>Corpus Apologetarum</i>
(3d edition, 1879), while F. X. Funk (<i>Patres apostolici,</i> 2d
edition, 1901, later revisions by F. Diekamp and K. Bihlmeyer),
on whose text this translation is based, made use of the
Tübingen transcript. No major textual problems are presented
by these more or less independent witnesses, but there are
obvious lacunae at ch. 7:8 and ch. 10:8, and there may be a
small break at ch. 10:1. While a number of readings are
doubtful in detail, the emendations proposed by Lachmann
and Bunsen in Bunsen’s <i>Analecta Ante-Nicaena</i>, Vol. I (1854),
have found favor with most editors.</p>
      <h4 id="x.i.i-p3.1">Date and Authorship</h4>
      <p id="x.i.i-p4">Some critics have been led by the Epistle’s peculiar history
to regard it as a brilliant forgery, while others have looked on
it as a mere showpiece, without any real relation to the experience
of the Early Church. The real beauty, however, of its
picture of the Christian life, the freshness of its language, and
the undeveloped character of its theology all combine to suggest
a date in the second or the early third century, and to guarantee
the authenticity of the Epistle as an expression of early Christian
piety.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p5">To place it more precisely is another matter. Justin, to whom
the MS. attributes the Epistle, is impossible. It does share with
Justin’s writings certain commonplaces of early apologetic,
but some striking differences must be noted, such as our
Epistle’s disregard of Hebrew prophecy and contempt for Greek
philosophy. Furthermore, the style of the work is far superior
to Justin’s.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p6">A stronger candidate, whose claims have recently been
revived by Dom P. Andriessen, is Quadratus of Asia Minor,
who (in 123–124 or 129) addressed an “Apology” to the emperor

<span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_207"/>  <strong>{Page 207}</strong> Hadrian.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p6.1" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p6.1"><sup class="Note">612</sup></a> Andriessen argues that the fragment dealing with
Christ’s healing miracles, which Eusebius quotes from Quadratus,
fits very appropriately into the lacuna at Diog. 7:8. He
also notes a number of passages in the Epistle that make the
identification of “Diognetus” with Hadrian most plausible.
The fact that Jerome was probably mistaken in identifying Quadratus,
whom he describes as <i><span><a id="x.i.i-p9.1"/>discipulus apostolorum</span></i>, with the bishop
of Athens of the same name, is not really relevant, and it is
certainly true that the internal evidence points to the view that
our Epistle, like Quadratus’ Apology, originated in Asia Minor.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p10">Before making use of this evidence, however, we must deal
with the prior problem of the integrity of the Epistle and the
related question of the possible common authorship of the two
sections into which the lacuna at ch. 10:8 seems to divide it. It
may be briefly stated that, on grounds of style alone, the critic is
justified in doubting the unity of the Epistle as it stands, while
differences of outlook between chs. 1 to 10 and 11; 12 (e.g.,
with respect to the Old Testament) decide the matter conclusively.
Moreover, while the bulk of the differences might be
explained by the assumption that the same author produced
the two distinct sections at different times and for different
purposes, the unresolved differences make the hypothesis of a
common authorship untenable. At the same time, since the
community of fundamental outlook is obvious enough, we can
hardly doubt that the two documents stem from closely related
circles. An examination of this common viewpoint may help
us to place the two authors more exactly.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p11">The Epistle as a whole is classical in style, with definite
Biblical overtones. The Pauline influence is often perceptible,
while the Johannine outlook dominates the work.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p11.1" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p11.1"><sup class="Note">613</sup></a> When one notes in addition the obvious influence of Ephesians and First

<span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_208"/>  <strong>{Page 208}</strong> Peter on the Epistle, the case for the Asian origin of the latter
becomes very strong indeed.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p12">Among post-Biblical influences that have been detected, a
number are of secondary importance for our understanding of
Diognetus. J. Armitage Robinson, for example, has shown that
The Preaching of Peter (c. 100–130) underlies both the Epistle
and the Apology of Aristides, but some of his evidence is too
general to be relevant, and none of it outweighs the divergence
of outlook between the Epistle and the passages from the
Preaching preserved by Clement of Alexandria, although it
remains clear that our author (of Diog., chs. 1 to 10) was
familiar with the latter in some form.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p12.1" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p12.1"><sup class="Note">614</sup></a> Similarly, while resemblances
have been noted between the Epistle and the Apology
of Aristides itself, the evidence hardly goes far enough to justify
a definite assertion of the influence of either upon the other,
and certainly fails to demonstrate a common authorship.
Pfleiderer, indeed, argues for “the acquaintance of the author
of the Epistle to Diognetus with the earlier Apology of Aristides,”
but this goes beyond the data, which simply indicate
<i>some</i> contact. It is not necessary, then, to play down the strongly
Asian character of our Epistle, or even to rule out Quadratus
as the author, simply on the ground that it must have been
influenced by (and thus be later than) the work of Aristides
the Athenian (c. 140).<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p13.1" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p13.1"><sup class="Note">615</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p16">The resemblances between the Epistle and the <i>Protrepticus</i>
of Clement of Alexandria (d.c. 215) are even more general, and
certainly do not justify the suggestion, contrary to the indications

<span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_209"/>  <strong>{Page 209}</strong> of another source and an earlier date, that the Epistle
simply reflects the work of Clement. It has been argued more
persuasively that it should be ascribed to Theophilus of Antioch
(whose three books <i>Ad Autolycum</i> appeared c. 180), but even here
the similarities are not strong enough to compel any such conclusion,
particularly in view of the relatively undeveloped
theology of the Epistle, although they do point to its Asian
provenance and to its link with the school represented by Irenaeus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p16.1" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p16.1"><sup class="Note">616</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p20">The most significant literary parallels, however, go beyond
this to establish without question the association of both
sections of our Epistle with that theology of Asia Minor which
so ably represented the central tradition of primitive Catholicism.
The work of R. H. Connolly puts the connection
between Diog., chs. 1 to 10, and both Irenaeus and Hippolytus
(particularly the latter’s anti-Gnostic work, the so-called
<i>Philosophumena)</i> beyond any reasonable doubt. As for chs.
11 and 12, Connolly has shown that they strikingly resemble
certain of the acknowledged writings of Hippolytus of Rome
(d. 235), while Campbell Bonner has pointed out certain
interesting stylistic parallels between these chapters and the
surviving fragments of the homilies of Melito of Sardis, who is
known to have exerted a strong influence on Hippolytus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.i-p20.1" href="#fnf_x.i.i-p20.1"><sup class="Note">617</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p24">In the light of the evidence thus summarily presented, it is
possible to offer a tentative answer to the question of date and
authorship. Our answer assumes that chs. 1 to 10 were written
by Quadratus in Asia Minor, as Andriessen argues, and

<span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_210"/>  <strong>{Page 210}</strong> constitute the body of his Apology to Hadrian (129?). This
will account for the strong Asian (notably Johannine) flavor of
the work, and for its relatively primitive character. If this
precise identification is not accepted, we must still attribute
the Epistle to the same period and circle. R. H. Connolly’s
explanation of the relationships involved in terms of the dependence
of our author (identified with Hippolytus) on Irenaeus,
rather than in terms of the influence of an earlier writing on
Irenaeus and through him on Hippolytus, fails to account for
such significant factors as the attitude of our author toward the
Old Testament, his relatively rudimentary Christology, and
his failure to refer to the Church’s Tradition (<i>paradosis</i>), which
on the other hand played so large a part in the teaching of
Irenaeus and Hippolytus.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p25">As far as chs. 11 and 12 are concerned, the argument for
Hippolytean authorship, as summed up by R. H. Connolly,
seems convincing enough, although the case for the identification
of the fragment as the lost tenth book of the <i>Philosophumena</i>
may well be thought less persuasive, and we may prefer to regard
it as a festal homily. At any rate, this over-all theory,
with its ascription of chs. 1 to 10 to a predecessor of Irenaeus,
and its attribution of chs. 11; 12 to one of his successors, offers
a more comprehensive treatment of the evidence than any
alternatives that have so far been presented.</p>
      <h4 id="x.i.i-p25.1">Purpose and Content</h4>
      <p id="x.i.i-p26">The bulk of the Epistle (chs. 1 to 10) constitutes an apology for
Christianity, based on the unique part played by Christians in
society. This argument is set in the context of a “theology of
history,” which emphasizes the divine initiative as decisive for
history, and contrasts Christianity as a supernatural factor in
human relationships with the man-made religion of Gentiles
and Jews alike. The attack on non-Christian religions is sometimes
unfair and superficial, and must have had a very mixed
effect on pagan readers, but the description of Christian life
in the world comes to us across eighteen centuries with an
astounding force and fragrance. To this moving statement
someone possessed of a remarkable sense of fitness has added
the passage from Hippolytus (chs. 11; 12), with its announcement
of God’s gifts of grace and truth in Christ’s Church, where
at this very moment Christians can renew their life at that
divine source from which its unique power flows.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_211"/>  <strong>{Page 211}</strong> 
      <p id="x.i.i-p27">This vivid symbolic expression of the supernatural character
of Christian life points up the fundamental theological theme
of the body of the Epistle, which is concerned to present
Christianity as a supernatural mystery. The writer deals with
the first of Diognetus’ supposed questions by affirming that the
God whom Christians worship, to the contempt of all so-called
gods, is the transcendent Lord of all things, who in his “Child”
has revealed himself to men, destroying the divinities of human
imagination. He goes on to argue that the nature of Christian
life is itself a primary piece of evidence for the intrinsically
supernatural basis of the Christian religion. Christians are
different and mysterious, because they live by a superhuman
power. The reader should note the numerous references to
Christianity as a “mystery,” and the realistic doctrine of
sanctifying grace with which this emphasis is allied, as again
and again the Christian doctrine of God and the glowing
portrayal of Christian life are brought together.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p28">The very novelty of Christianity shows its transcendent origin.
The description of Christians as the “New Race” reflects,
in language widely used in the Early Church, the Biblical
expression of the supernatural in terms of the “New Age,
Covenant, Creation.” In other words, the Epistle manifests
the strong historical sense characteristic of the Bible itself, and
sees in the supernatural mystery of Christianity the fulfillment
of the divine purpose in the creation of nature, worked out in
history in accordance with the possibilities of historical situations.
In the exposition of the divine <i>oikonomia</i> in history, this
apprehension of the truth that the divine wisdom acts in accordance
with the historical <i>kairos</i> is more effectively expressed than
in any other writing before Irenaeus’ magnificent picture of the
workings of Providence. Some appreciation of this profound
understanding of Christianity that underlies both the Epistle
proper and the Hippolytean epilogue is necessary, if we are not
to be led by the Epistle’s tightly controlled use of its dogmatic
material into overlooking its deepest roots; and the reader
should always be on the watch for these fundamental
theological motifs.</p>
      <h4 id="x.i.i-p28.1">Aids to Study</h4>
      <p id="x.i.i-p29">Since this edition is intended as a simple introduction to
the Epistle by way of notes on its background and central
themes, accompanying a free English translation, the reader
who is attracted to the study of Diognetus must go on to more

<span class="pb" id="x.i.i-Page_212"/>  <strong>{Page 212}</strong> adequate treatments of the Epistle. Hence this preamble
should conclude with a guide (necessarily brief and selective)
to the relevant literature.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p30">Among the standard English editions, which the student will
want to consult, the place of honor belongs to Lightfoot’s
<i>Apostolic Fathers</i> (5 vols., 1886–1890, on which all subsequent
study of all these writings has in some measure depended),
despite the fact that the English translations are less readable
than most. Kirsopp Lake’s well-known Loeb Classical Library
edition (<i>The Apostolic Fathers</i>, II, 1913, reprinted, Putnam, 1930)
offers a very literal (although not uniformly accurate) translation,
founded on Otto’s text, which is printed in parallel, and
prefaced by a slight introduction. James Kleist, in Ancient
Christian Writers, No. 6 (1948), gives us a useful introduction,
followed by a free-flowing translation—the best in English.
<i>The Epistle to Diognetus</i>, by H. G. Meecham, with its critical
text, founded on that of Funk, and its exhaustive introduction
and notes, is an indispensable tool for the scholarly
study of the Epistle. Its (very pedestrian) translation is always
reliable, while its introductory material is a mine of accurate
references to other editions and to secondary material, as well
as to illustrative passages from classical literature.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p31">Reference should also be made to the standard general
histories of patristic literature and thought, among which B.
Altaner’s <i>Patrologie</i> (2d edition, 1950) gives the most up-to-date
account of the subject, with very full references to contemporary
studies, both in German and in other languages. A. Harnack’s
<i>Mission and Expansion of Christianity</i> (E.T., 2 vols., 1908),
contains the richest account of the life of the Church in the age
of Diognetus, and should most certainly be read, provided
that one is aware of its learned author’s occasional weakness
for substituting “liberal” intuitions for scholarship.</p>
      <p id="x.i.i-p32">Apart from items otherwise mentioned in the introduction
and notes, attention should be called to three useful discussions
of the outlook of the Apologists: J. Rivière, <i>St. Justin et les
apologistes du second siècle</i> (1907); P. Carrington, <i>Christian Apologetics
of the Second Century</i> (1921); and A. Puech, <i>Les Apoligistes
grecs du II<sup> e</sup> siècle de notre ère</i> (1912: the best comprehensive
treatment of the Apologists). With the help of these works, the
reader should acquire a fuller appreciation of the enterprise
undertaken by the Apologists, and a better understanding of
the peculiar contribution made by tile Epistle to Diognetus.</p>

      <h4 id="x.i.ii-p1.2">The Mystery  of the New People</h4>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p2"><b>1</b> To His Excellency, Diognetus:</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p3">I understand, sir, that you are really interested in learning
about the religion of the Christians, and that you are making
an accurate and careful investigation of the subject. You want
to know, for instance, what God they believe in and how they
worship him, while at the same time they disregard the world
and look down on death, and how it is that they do not treat
the divinities of the Greeks as gods at all, although on the other
hand they do not follow the superstition of the Jews. You would
also like to know the source of the loving
affection that they
have for each other. You wonder, too, why this new race or
way of life has appeared on earth now and not earlier.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p3.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p3.1"><sup class="Note">618</sup></a> I certainly welcome this keen interest on your part and I ask
God, who gives us the power to speak and the power to listen,
to let me speak in such a way that you may derive the greatest
possible benefit from listening, and to enable you to listen to
such good effect that I may never have a reason for regretting
what I have said.  <sup>2</sup>Now, then, clear out all the thoughts that

take up your attention, and pack away all the old ways of
looking at things that keep deceiving you. You must become

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_214"/>  <strong>{Page 214}</strong> like a new man from the beginning, since, as you yourself
admit, you are going to listen to a really new message.</p>
      <h4 id="x.i.ii-p3.5">The Stupidity  of Idolatry</h4>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p4">Look at the things that you proclaim and think of as gods.
See with your outward eyes and with your mind what material

they are made of and what form they happen to have.  <sup>2</sup>Is not
one a stone, like the stones we walk on, and another bronze,
no better than the utensils that have been forged for our use?
Here is a wooden one, already rotting away, and one made of
silver, that needs a watchman to protect it from being stolen.
Yet another one is made of iron, eaten by rust, and another
of pottery, no more attractive than something provided for the

most ignoble purpose.  <sup>3</sup>Were not all these things made out of
perishable material? Were they not forged by iron and fire?
Surely the stonemason made one of them, and the blacksmith
another, the silversmith a third, and the potter a fourth! These
things have been molded into their present shapes by the arts
of these craftsmen. Before they were shaped, they could just
as easily have been given a different form—and would this not
be possible even now? Could not vessels like them be made out
of the same material, if the same craftsmen happened to be

available?  <sup>4</sup>Moreover, could not these things that you worship
now be made by men into vessels like any others? They are all
dumb, after all, and blind. They are without life or feeling or

power of movement, all rotting away and decaying.  <sup>5</sup>These
are the things you call gods, the things you serve. You Gentiles

adore these things, and in the end you become like them.  <sup>6</sup>That
is why you hate the Christians, because they do not believe that

these objects are gods.  <sup>7</sup>But is it not you yourselves who, when
in your own thoughts you suppose that you are praising the
gods, are in reality despising them? Surely it is mockery and
insult to worship your stone and earthenware gods without
bothering to guard them, while you lock up your gods of silver
and gold at night, and set guards over them during the day,
to keep them from being stolen.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p5"><sup>8</sup>Moreover, if they are not lacking in sensation, you punish
them by the very honors you try to pay them, while, if they are
senseless, you show them up by the mere act of worshiping


them with blood and sacrificial fat.  <sup>9</sup>Just picture one of yourselves enduring this kind of thing, or allowing it to be done to
him! There is not one man who would willingly tolerate this

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_215"/>  <strong>{Page 215}</strong> sort of punishment, because he has feeling and intelligence,
but the stone tolerates it, because it has no feeling. Do you
not then really disprove its power of feeling?  <sup>10</sup>I could say a good deal more about the fact that Christians are not the slaves of
gods like these, but if anyone cannot see the force of these
arguments, I think that nothing is to be gained by arguing
the matter further.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p5.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">619</sup></a></p>
      <h4 id="x.i.ii-p5.6">The Superstitions of Judiaism</h4>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p6"><b>3</b> Next, I gather that you are particularly anxious to hear why
Christians do not worship in the same way as Jews.  <sup>2</sup>It is true
that the Jews refrain from the kind of worship that I have been
describing, and on this score they are right in thinking that
they adore the one God of all things and honor him as Lord;
but since they offer this worship more or less in the same manner
as those already mentioned, they are completely mistaken.  <sup>3</sup>While the Greeks provide a proof of their own lack of
understanding, by making offerings to senseless and deaf objects,
the Jews themselves might perhaps consider it folly rather than
piety if they only recognized that they were offering gifts to
God just as if he needed them.  <sup>4</sup>For “he who made the heaven
and the earth and all that is in them,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p6.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">620</sup></a> and provides us with
everything we need, can scarcely need any of the things that
he himself supplies to those who fancy that they are giving
something to him.  <sup>5</sup>It seems clear to me that people who
imagine that they are offering sacrifices to him when they give
blood and fat and whole burnt offerings, and are really honoring
him by these tokens of reverence, do not differ at all from
people who pay the same honor to deaf images. The latter
think that they are offering something to objects which in

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_216"/>  <strong>{Page 216}</strong> reality cannot appropriate the honor, while the former imagine
that they are giving something to him who has need of nothing.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p7"><b>4</b> As for Jewish taboos with respect to food, along with their
superstition about the Sabbath, their bragging about circumcision, and their hypocrisy about fast days and new moons,
I hardly think that you need to be told by me that all these
things are ridiculous, and not worth arguing about.  <sup>2</sup>How can it be anything but godlessness that makes men accept
some of the things made by God for man’s use as created good,
and reject other things as useless and superfluous?
 <sup>3</sup>And is it not impious to pretend that God forbids a good deed on the
Sabbath Day?  <sup>4</sup>And are they not asking for ridicule when they
boast of the mutilation of the flesh as a sign of their choice by
God, as if for this reason they were especially beloved by him?
 <sup>5</sup>Again, when they constantly gaze at the stars and watch
the moon, in order to observe months and days with scrupulous
care and to distinguish the changes of the seasons which God
has ordained, in order to cater to their own whims, making
some into festivals, and others into times of mourning, who
could call this evidence of devotion rather than of folly?
 <sup>6</sup>All this being so, I think that you have learned enough to see that
Christians are right in holding themselves aloof from the
aimlessness and trickery of Greeks and Jews alike, and from
the officiousness and noisy conceit of the Jews. But as far as the
mystery of the Christians’ own religion is concerned, you cannot expect to learn that from man.</p>
      <h4 id="x.i.ii-p7.1">The Church  in the World<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p7.2" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p7.2"><sup class="Note">621</sup></a> </h4>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p8"><b>5</b> For Christians cannot be distinguished from the rest of the
human race by country or language or customs.  <sup>2</sup>They do not live in cities of their own; they do not use a peculiar form of
speech; they do not follow an eccentric manner of life.  <sup>3</sup>This doctrine of theirs has not been discovered by the ingenuity or
deep thought of inquisitive men, nor do they put forward a

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_217"/>  <strong>{Page 217}</strong> merely human teaching, as some people do.  <sup>4</sup>Yet, although they
live in Greek and barbarian cities alike, as each man’s lot has
been cast, and follow the customs of the country in clothing
and food and other matters of daily living, at the same time
they give proof of the remarkable and admittedly extraordinary
constitution of their own commonwealth.  <sup>5</sup>They live in their

unseen.  <sup>5</sup>The flesh hates the soul and treats it as an enemy,
even though it has suffered no wrong, because it is prevented

even though it suffers no wrong at their hands, because they
range themselves against its pleasures.  <sup>6</sup>The soul loves the flesh

      <p id="x.i.ii-p10"><b>7</b> As I have indicated, it is not an earthly discovery that was
committed to them; it is not a mortal thought that they think
of as worth guarding with such care, nor have they been entrusted with the stewardship of merely human mysteries.  <sup>2</sup>On the contrary, it was really the Ruler of all, the Creator of all,
the invisible God himself, who from heaven established the
truth and the holy, incomprehensible word among men, and
fixed it firmly in their hearts. Nor, as one might suppose, did
he do this by sending to men some subordinate—an angel, or
principality, or one of those who administer earthly affairs, or
perhaps one of those to whom the government of things in
heaven is entrusted. Rather, he sent the Designer and Maker
of the universe himself, by whom he created the heavens and
confined the sea within its own bounds—him whose hidden
purposes all the elements of the world faithfully carry out,
him from whom the sun has received the measure of the daily

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_219"/>  <strong>{Page 219}</strong> rounds that it must keep, him whom the moon obeys when he
commands her to shine by night, and whom the stars obey
as they follow the course of the moon. He sent him by whom all
things have been set in order and distinguished and placed in
subjection—the heavens and the things that are in the heavens,
the earth and the things in the earth, the sea and the things in
the sea, fire, air, the unfathomed pit, the things in the heights and
in the depths and in the realm between; God sent him to men.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p11"><sup>3</sup>Now, did he send him, as a human mind might assume, to
rule by tyranny, fear, and terror?  <sup>4</sup>Far from it! He sent him out
of kindness and gentleness, like a king sending his son who is
himself a king. He sent him as God; he sent him as man to men.
He willed to save man by persuasion, not by compulsion, for
compulsion is not God’s way of working.  <sup>5</sup>In sending him, God
called men, but did not pursue them; he sent him in love, not
in judgment.  <sup>6</sup>Yet he will indeed send him someday as our
Judge, and who shall stand when he appears?<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p11.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p11.1"><sup class="Note">625</sup></a> . . .</p>

them deny the Lord, and how they are not vanquished?  <sup>8</sup>Do you not see that the more of them are punished, the more do others
increase?  <sup>9</sup>These things do not seem to come from a human
power; they are a mighty act of God; they are proofs of his presence.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p13"><b>8</b> As a matter of fact, before he came, what man had any
knowledge of God at all?  <sup>2</sup>Or do you really accept the idle
nonsense talked by those plausible philosophers, some of whom
asserted that God was fire—the very thing that they are on the
point of going to, they call God!—while others claimed that
he was water, and others said that he was yet another one of
the elements created by God?  <sup>3</sup>And yet, if any one Of these lines
of argument is acceptable, then each and every one of the other
creatures could in the same way be shown to be God.  <sup>4</sup>No, this is just quackery and deceit practiced by wizards.  <sup>5</sup>No man has ever seen God or made him known, but he has manifested
himself.  <sup>6</sup>And he manifested himself through faith, by which
alone it has been made possible for us to see God.</p>

      <p id="x.i.ii-p14"><sup>7</sup>For God, the Master and Maker of the universe, who made
all things and determined the proper place of each, showed
himself to be long-suffering, as well as a true friend of man.  <sup>8</sup>But
in fact he always was and is and will be just this—kind and
good and slow to anger and true; indeed, he alone is good.  <sup>9</sup>And when he had planned a great and unutterable design, he
communicated it to his Child alone.  <sup>10</sup>Now, as long as he kept
back his own wise counsel as a well-guarded mystery, he seemed
to be neglecting us and to take no interest in us;  <sup>11</sup>but when he
revealed it through his beloved Child and made known the
things that had been prepared from the beginning, he granted
us all things at once. He made us both to share in his blessings
and to see and understand things that none of us could ever
have looked for.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p15"><b>9</b> And so, when he had planned everything by himself in union
with his Child, he still allowed us, through the former time, to
be carried away by undisciplined impulses, captivated by
pleasures and lusts, just as we pleased. That does not mean that
he took any delight in our sins, but only that he showed
patience. He did not approve at all of that season of wickedness, but on the contrary, all the time he was creating the present age of righteousness, so that we, who in the past had by
our own actions been proved unworthy of life, might now be
deemed worthy, thanks to God’s goodness. Then, when we had
shown ourselves incapable of entering the Kingdom of God
by our own efforts, we might be made capable of doing so by
the power of God.  <sup>2</sup>And so, when our unrighteousness had come
to its full term, and it had become perfectly plain that its
recompense of punishment and death had to be expected, then
the season arrived in which God had determined to show at
last his goodness and power. O the overflowing kindness and
love of God toward man! God did not hate us, or drive us
away, or bear us ill will. Rather, he was long-suffering and forbearing. In his mercy, he took up the burden of our sins. He
himself gave up his own Son as a ransom for us—the holy one
for the unjust, the innocent for the guilty, the righteous one for
the unrighteous, the incorruptible for the corruptible, the immortal for the mortal.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p15.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p15.1"><sup class="Note">626</sup></a>  <sup>3</sup>For what else could cover our sins

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_221"/>  <strong>{Page 221}</strong> except his righteousness?  <sup>4</sup>In whom could we, lawless and impious as we were, be made righteous except in the Son of God
alone?  <sup>5</sup>O sweetest exchange! O unfathomable work of God!
O blessings beyond all expectation! The sinfulness of many is
hidden in the Righteous One, while the righteousness of the
One justifies the many that are sinners.  <sup>6</sup>In the former time he
had proved to us our nature’s inability to gain life; now he
showed the Saviour’s power to save even the powerless, with
the intention that on both counts we should have faith in his
goodness, and look on him as Nurse, Father, Teacher, Counselor, Healer, Mind, Light, Honor, Glory, Might, Life—and
that we should not be anxious about clothing and food.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p16"><b>10</b> If you too yearn for this faith, then first of all you must
acquire full knowledge of the Father.  <sup>2</sup>For God loved men, and
made the world for their sake, and put everything on earth
under them. He gave them reason and intelligence, and to them
alone he entrusted the capacity for looking upward to him,
since he formed them after his own image. It was to them that
he sent his only-begotten Son, and to them that he promised the
Kingdom in heaven which he will give to those who love him.  <sup>3</sup>And when you have acquired this knowledge, think with what
joy you will be filled! Think how you will love him, who first
loved you so!  <sup>4</sup>And when you love him, you will be an imitator
of his goodness. And do not be surprised to hear that a man
can become an imitator of God. He can, because God wills it.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p17"><sup>5</sup>To be happy does not, indeed, consist in lording it over one’s
neighbors, or in longing to have some advantage over the
weaker ones, or in being rich and ordering one’s inferiors
about. It is not in this way that any man can imitate God, for
such things are alien to his majesty.  <sup>6</sup>But if a man takes his
neighbor’s burden on himself, and is willing to help his inferior
in some respect in which he himself is better off, and, by providing the needy with what he himself possesses because he has
received it from God, becomes a god to those who receive it—then this man is an imitator of God.  <sup>7</sup>Then, while your lot is
cast on earth, you will realize that God rules in heaven; then
you will begin to talk of the mysteries of God; then you will
love and admire those who are being punished for their refusal
to deny God; then you will condemn the fraud and error of the
world, once you really understand the true life in heaven, once
you look down on the apparent death here below, once you
fear the real death kept for those who are condemned to the
eternal fire, which will punish to the end those that are handed

      <h4 id="x.i.ii-p17.2">THE TEXT: (II) A HOMILY CONCERNING THE MYSTERY OF FAITH</h4>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p18"><b>11</b> I am not speaking of things that are strange to me, nor is
my undertaking unreasonable, for I have been a disciple of
apostles, and now I am becoming a teacher of the Gentiles.
The things that pertain to the tradition I try to minister fittingly
to those who are becoming disciples of the truth.  <sup>2</sup>Can any man
who has been properly taught, and has come to love the Logos,
keep from trying to learn precisely what has been shown openly
by the Logos to those to whom he manifestly appeared and
spoke in the plainest terms? He remained, indeed, unrecognized
by unbelievers, but he gave a full explanation to his disciples
who, because he looked upon them as faithful, came to know
the mysteries of the Father.  <sup>3</sup>For this reason the Father sent the
Logos to appear to the world—the Logos who was slighted by
the chosen people, but preached by apostles and believed in
by the Gentiles.  <sup>4</sup>This is he who was from the beginning, who
appeared new and was found to be old, and is ever born young
in the hearts of the saints.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p18.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p18.1"><sup class="Note">628</sup></a>  <sup>5</sup>This is the eternal one, who today is accounted a Son,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p18.2" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p18.2"><sup class="Note">629</sup></a> by whom the Church is made rich
and grace is multiplied as it unfolds among the saints—the
grace that gives understanding, makes mysteries plain,
announces seasons, rejoices in believers, is given freely to
seekers, that is, to such as do not break the pledges of their

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_223"/>  <strong>{Page 223}</strong> faith,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p18.4" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p18.4"><sup class="Note">630</sup></a> or go beyond the bounds set by the fathers.  <sup>6</sup>Then the reverence taught by the Law is hymned, and the grace given
to the Prophets is recognized, and the faith of the Gospels is
made secure, and the tradition of the apostles is maintained,
and the grace of the Church exults.  <sup>7</sup>And if you do not grieve
this grace, you will understand what the Logos speaks, through
whom he pleases and whenever he chooses.  <sup>8</sup>For we simply share with you, out of love for the things that have been
revealed to us, everything that we have been prompted to
speak out under stress, in obedience to the will and commandment of the Logos.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p19"><b>12</b> If you read this, and listen to it earnestly, you will discover
what God has prepared for those who love him as they ought,
and have become a Paradise of delight, cultivating in themselves a flourishing tree, rich with all kinds of fruit, while they
themselves are decked out with a variety of fruits;  <sup>2</sup>for in this Garden a tree of knowledge and a tree of life have been planted.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p19.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p19.1"><sup class="Note">631</sup></a> But it is not the tree of knowledge that destroys; it
is disobedience that brings destruction.  <sup>3</sup>Indeed, there is a deep
meaning in the passage of Scripture which tells how God
in the beginning planted a tree of knowledge and a tree of life
in the midst of Paradise, to show that life is attained through
knowledge. It was because the first men did not use this knowledge with clean hearts that they were stripped of it by the
deceit of the serpent.  <sup>4</sup>For there cannot be life without knowledge
any more than there can be sound knowledge without genuine
life, and so the two trees were planted close together.  <sup>5</sup>Because
the apostle saw the force of this, he found fault with the knowledge that is put into effect in life without regard to the reality of
the commandment, pointing out that “knowledge puffs up,
but love builds up.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p19.3" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p19.3"><sup class="Note">632</sup></a>  <sup>6</sup>For the man who thinks he knows anything apart from knowledge that is genuine and borne out by

<span class="pb" id="x.i.ii-Page_224"/>  <strong>{Page 224}</strong> life has actually learned nothing, but is deceived by the serpent,
because he does not love life. But he who has gained full knowledge with reverence and seeks after life can plant in hope and
look for fruit.</p>
      <p id="x.i.ii-p20"><sup>7</sup>Let your heart be knowledge, and your life the true teaching
that your heart contains.  <sup>8</sup>If you bear the tree of this teaching and pluck its fruit, you will always be gathering in the things
that are desirable in the sight of God, things that the serpent
cannot touch and deceit cannot defile. Then Eve is not seduced,
but a Virgin is found trustworthy.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.i.ii-p20.1" href="#fnf_x.i.ii-p20.1"><sup class="Note">633</sup></a>  <sup>9</sup>Furthermore, salvation is
displayed, and the apostles are interpreted, and the Lord’s
Passover goes forward, and the seasons are brought together
and set in order, and the Logos rejoices as he teaches the saints—the
Logos through whom the Father is glorified. To him be
glory forevermore. Amen.</p>

quote an obscure upholder of the ultraspiritual doctrine of the Church
(more judiciously defended by Sohm). Altogether apart, however, from
the Hippolytean fragment, the whole discussion of the Christian’s

On the other hand, the passage could embody an allusion to <a class="scripRef" id="x.i.ii-p18.3">Rom. 1:5</a>,

      <h3 id="x.ii.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <h4 id="x.ii.i-p0.2">Early Christian Apologies</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p1"><span class="sc">The danger of persecution on the one hand</span>,
and increasing opportunities for the propagation of the
gospel on the other, produced the ancient Christian
writings that are known generally, from the title of some of
them, as Apologies. Eusebius tells us that they began in the
time of Hadrian with the Apology of Quadratus, from which
he preserves only a brief fragment.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p1.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p1.2"><sup class="Note">634</sup></a> Early in the principate of
Antoninus comes Aristides of Athens, whose Apology has been
recovered from various fragments in our own time—a straightforward claim that the Christians hold the true faith and live
as God commands, put forward with considerable charm.
Justin comes logically next in the series; his distinguishing
feature among the Apologists is the scope of what he tries
to include—a reply to the legal and moral attacks and an
exhibition of the Old Testament basis of the gospel.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p2">By the middle of the second century attacks on Christianity
as well as defenses of it were in circulation. A work by Marcus
Aurelius’ teacher, Fronto, seems to have put the legal and moral
charges in a form calculated to gain the attention of Apologists
connected with Rome. Somewhat later came Celsus’ True
Word, which was to wait two generations for Origin’s massive
reply. Under Marcus Aurelius, Athenagoras of Athens produced
his Plea Concerning Christians, the most polished of the
Apologies as a literary work. Athenagoras draws largely on Justin
(though not on his Old Testament quotations), and anticipates
Clement in his skillful use of Greek literary quotations, It
seems fair to say that the Athenian Apologists are
more interested in the religious claims of Christianity, the Roman in its civic
<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_226"/>  <strong>{Page 226}</strong> status, though without neglecting its claim to present the true
faith in God. Christian literature in the language of the Romans
begins with the Latin Apologists of the end of the century,
Tertullian and Minucius Felix. About the same time Clement
of Alexandria, in his Address to the Greeks, presents Christianity as the true mystery, by which we reach the spiritual light
that Eleusis fallaciously promised. The Apologists whom we
may call Oriental are more concerned to maintain the claims
of Christianity against rival religions. Tatian the Assyrian,
after being Justin’s pupil at Rome, returned to his native land
and ultimately became the founder of a puritanical and dualistic sect; earlier he had shown his tendencies by attacking
Greek thought and pagan practice in his Discourse to the
Greeks. Theophilus of Antioch in his work To Autolycus
defends prophets against philosophers with a rather narrow
vigor. The most original work of Syrian Christianity deserves
inclusion in the list; astrology and the slavery of fate, touched
on by other Apologists, was the main topic of On Fate by
Bardesanes of Edessa. Like some other Apologists in various ages,
he may concede too much—the stars may control external events,
he says, but not the spiritual character and moral actions of man.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p3">Though apologetics is a permanent part of Christian writing,
these writers complete the roll of the classical Apologists of the
Greco-Roman world. Still close to them are Origen’s Against
Celsus and Cyprian’s brief practical appeal To Donatus (or
Epistle <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.ii.i-p3.1"/>I</span>) in the middle of the third century. Finally ancient
apologetic was revived by the return of somewhat similar
conditions during the reign of Diocletian and the early years of
Constantine. The works of Arnobius and Lactantius in the
West belong to this period, and at Alexandria Athanasius’
work Against the Nations ends the period of ancient apologetic
while the companion piece On the Incarnation opens the
classical age of conciliar Christology.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p4">Understanding of the Apologists can be assisted by some
attention to the literary forms that they employed. The first
Christian writers, indeed, clearly had classical literary forms in
mind, since they wrote in some hope of reaching a general
audience. An Apology is by definition a speech for the defense.
The use of the form for philosophic propaganda goes back to
the illustrious example of Plato’s Apology of Socrates. It is this
surely that brings Socrates so naturally to Justin’s mind in the
First Apology,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p4.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p4.1"><sup class="Note">635</sup></a> or makes him say in the Second, “Would that

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_227"/>  <strong>{Page 227}</strong> even now someone would mount on a lofty rostrum and cry
out” the message of the Apologist.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p4.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p4.2"><sup class="Note">636</sup></a> The word and form already occur in Paul’s two Apologies in Acts, chs. 22 and
26—where, like the later Apologists, Luke realizes that the best defense in
these matters is attack, and that a plea for the toleration of
Christianity might as well include an argument for its truth.
There were also pagan parallels to both the Apology and the
related form of the Acts of Martyrs, especially in the so-called
“pagan Acts of the Martyrs,” which represent the claims of
the city of Alexandria. Since the preparation of possible or
purely imaginary speeches was an important part of high education in Roman times, the use of the form in literary composition is natural. In a speech a brief exordium, aiming to please the audience or at least grasp its attention, is likely to lead to
a detailed exhibition of the main point, and then subordinate
points and a conclusion will follow rapidly. If a speaker (or
preacher) announces three points, he knows that the second
and third should be shorter than the first, or the audience will
be murmuring “ten minutes more of this.” Hence the difficulty
of finding a balanced outline in the rhetorical Apologies—Justin, Athenagoras, and Tertullian. In each case the main
point is in the center of the work—Tertullian and Athenagoras
argue for belief in God, Justin for recognition of Jesus as the
predicted Messiah—and there are relatively briefer introductions and conclusions.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p5">Though in form a plea for toleration, the Apology was certainly written even more as an appeal for conversion. Here also
there was a pagan parallel in the protreptic discourse or exhortation, written to commend some philosophical or ethical position. Such discourses were the stock in trade of the wandering
philosophers who were the popular preachers of paganism.
Literary references were specially in place in such writing;
Clement’s Address to the Greeks is the fullest example among
the Apologists, though all exhibit some features of the form. A
brief protreptic discourse could be written in the form of an
epistle, such as those that make up the three books of Seneca’s

<i>Epistolae Morales</i>—among Christian Apologists there is the
Epistle to Diognetus and Cyprian’s <i>Ad Donatum</i>. Perhaps
Justin’s Second Apology can best be read as an Epistle to the
Romans. Since the Apologists were conducting an argument,

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_228"/>  <strong>{Page 228}</strong> the dialogue form would naturally suggest itself, if they wanted
to give their opponents that much space. Justin uses it with some
skill in the Dialogue with Trypho, including such minor
features, familiar in the Platonic dialogue, as that the whole
conversation is allegedly recounted afterward by one of the
participants, and that it includes a dialogue within a dialogue.
The Octavius of Minucius Felix is a more formal dialogue, or
rather debate. Like some of the dialogues of Cicero, it opens
with a genre picture of Roman life, which Minucius handles
with considerable charm. Least of all among Apologies do we
find the formal treatise, arguing and expounding various
aspects of a subject, though this was also not unknown and is
represented by Theophilus of Antioch. This form was especially
appropriate to a work that replied point by point to the arguments of an attacker, as Josephus had done in his two books
Against Apion and as Origen did in his eight Against Celsus.</p>
      <h4 id="x.ii.i-p5.1">Justin’s Life  and Work</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p6">In spite of a certain lack of polish, perhaps because of it,
Justin Martyr is one of the greatest of the Apologists. His
writings have the additional interest of being the most specifically Christian of the ancient Apologies. All of them deal in their
various ways with the permanent and ever-changing problem
of Christian apologetics—how to make contact between the
claims of the gospel and the needs and interests of the age,
while clearing away misunderstandings and prejudices. Most
of the other Apologists lead their reader to the door of the
church—Minucius Felix, indeed, does little more than point in
its general direction—while Justin opens it and tells a good
deal about what goes on inside. Much of the First Apology
reads more like a manual for inquirers than a defense for the
general public, and this feature gives it its great interest as a
record of the faith and practice of the middle of the second
century. Since his work was rediscovered in the sixteenth
century, Justin has received more attention than at any time
since his own generation. Both for the value of his own contribution to Christian thought and for the significance of his evidence as to what was believed and taught by the Christians of
his time, he undoubtedly deserves it.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p7">Justin tells us that he was the son of Priscus and grandson
of Bacchius. He was a native of Flavia Neapolis (ancient Shechem and modern Nablus) in Palestine: The family were

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_229"/>  <strong>{Page 229}</strong> evidently Gentile citizens of a Roman colony in Samaria, a
connection reflected in Justin’s occasional marked interest in
Samaritan affairs.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p7.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p7.1"><sup class="Note">637</sup></a> Though not Jewish, Justin brought from
his Palestinian home a consciousness of the Jewish background
of the faith that he ultimately adopted, later to be reflected in
the Old Testament discussions that take up so much of the
First Apology and are the subject of the Dialogue with Trypho.
But his own cultural and intellectual formation was certainly
Greek, and it was in philosophy that he looked for spiritual
satisfaction. The “I” of the Dialogue is not strictly autobiographical, but the experience it reflects is certainly Justin’s.
After some contact with other schools, he was deeply attracted
by Platonism, which seemed to show the way to the true knowledge of man and vision of God. But before he had gone very
far on that path, his attention was directed to the deeper wisdom
of the prophets of Israel as expounded by the Church, and in
that teaching he recognized the true philosophy which he had
been looking for. The example of the martyrs moved him to
give in his name to the persecuted sect of Christians.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p7.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p7.2"><sup class="Note">638</sup></a> Thereafter he continued, or perhaps began, to wear the philosopher’s
cloak, but as a professor of the divine philosophy, not of any
human school.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p8">Justin certainly ended his career as a Christian teacher at
Rome, but the stages of his journey there are obscure. Our
knowledge of them depends mainly on the evaluation of slight
references in the Dialogue with Trypho. Eusebius tells us that
the dialogue took place at Ephesus, although the only specific
indication in the present text suggests Corinth. Could there
be in Eusebius’ MS. or ours a slip of one Pauline city for another?<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p8.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p8.1"><sup class="Note">639</sup></a> Well-frequented lines of travel connected the
Christian centers of the province of Asia with Greece and Rome,
so that Justin may have lived in all three. If the evidence of
the Acts is to be trusted, he had left Rome and then returned
for a second stay at the time of his death.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p9">In our own time the identification of the Apostolic Tradition
of Hippolytus has provided a welcome complement to Justin’s
evidence about the customs of the Roman Church. Hippolytus
wrote about <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.ii.i-p9.1"/>A.D.</span> 200, some forty or fifty years later than
Justin. But since he aimed to describe customs that were already
old, the difference in time is not so important as it might seem.

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_230"/>  <strong>{Page 230}</strong> The liturgical evidence of the two writers interlocks remarkably,
and a passing reference in Hippolytus to the teachers who prepared candidates for baptism doubtless gives the clue to Justin’s
position in the Church. Christian teaching at Rome was carried
on by individuals who conducted, as it were, schools of Christianity. They were only indirectly subject to the discipline of the
Church, in case they developed heresies so clear as to call for
condemnation by the not very theologically minded leaders of
Roman Christendom. Since services were private, and held
from house to house, the residences of these teachers might be
the only publicly known Christian centers—as Justin says in
the Acts: “I live above one Martinus, at the Timiotinian Bath
and during the whole time (and I am now living in Rome
for the second time) I have been unaware of any other meeting
than this. And if anyone wished to come to me, I communicated to him the doctrines of truth.”</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p10">Though freely instructing prospective converts and interested Christians, these teachers did not as such occupy any
official position in the Church. Considered from another point
of view, they belonged to the class of popular teachers or
preachers who presented the religious claims of philosophy to
the common man. So the animosity of Crescens the Cynic for
Justin, which he expected would be the cause of his martyrdom,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p10.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p10.1"><sup class="Note">640</sup></a> had certain aspects of professional rivalry. The philosopher’s
cloak, one must remember, in this period was rather the habit
of a begging friar than the gown of a university professor.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p11">The chronology of Justin’s life depends mainly on the references in his works. The First Apology speaks of a recent episode
at Alexandria in the prefecture of Felix, who held office between
<span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.ii.i-p11.1"/>A.D.</span> 151 and 154;<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p11.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p11.2"><sup class="Note">641</sup></a> it is addressed to Antoninus Pius and his
adopted sons and colleagues, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius
Verus, whose formal association in the imperial dignity dates
from 147. We may date it safely about 155. The Dialogue with
Trypho is placed dramatically at the time of the Jewish War
of 132–135,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p11.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p11.3"><sup class="Note">642</sup></a> which may well be the approximate period of
Justin’s conversion. It is clearly, however, subsequent to the
Apology, to which it refers;<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p11.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p11.4"><sup class="Note">643</sup></a> its main theme is an enlargement of the central argument of the Apology, by more detailed exposition of Old Testament texts, to show that Christians are the
true heirs of the promises made to Israel. The Second Apology
also refers to the First. It was evidently written at a moment of
crisis for the Christians of Rome, when martyrdoms had

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_231"/>  <strong>{Page 231}</strong> occurred and Justin expected his own to follow shortly. Eusebius
dates Justin’s Second Apology and martyrdom early in the
years of Marcus Aurelius, and there is no reason to doubt the
correctness of that information. The Acts of Justin and other
martyrs are, as they stand, considerably later, but certainly
go back to a simple and authentic eyewitness account. As they
describe the events, Justin and six others were arrested, probably at the house of Martinus, and brought before the prefect
Rusticus. Justin’s fellow martyrs were simple folk with Greek
names, the most distinguished the imperial slave Euelpistus,
who had first learned the faith from his parents in far-off
Cappadocia. Justin had the chance to make such confession
as he longed for. But as soon as he had spoken of Father, Son,
and Spirit, the prefect, “who seems to have been bored at the
prospect of a sermon,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p11.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p11.5"><sup class="Note">644</sup></a> tried in vain to get more information
about Christian meeting places. Then came the fatal demand
for sacrifice, after which condemnation and execution followed
as a matter of course.</p>
      <h4 id="x.ii.i-p11.6">Justin’s Thought  and Interests</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p12">The detailed study of Justin’s ideas belongs elsewhere, but
some suggestions regarding his thought are in place in this
introduction.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p13">Modern readers tend to concentrate on what seems to be
unique, or what is of particular interest to us—for instance,
Justin’s use of the Logos concept, his attitude to philosophy,
and his evidence for worship and the sacraments. But his own
approach is primarily pastoral, Biblical, and traditionalist. He
writes everything with a pastoral or evangelistic purpose like
that of the Fourth Evangelist, “that ye might believe that Jesus
is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, ye might have
life through his name.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p13.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p13.1"><sup class="Note">645</sup></a> His recognition of the value of
philosophy is secondary to his desire to testify and demonstrate
that God has spoken through the prophets and redeemed us
through his Son. He is much less interested in expounding
his own ideas than in appealing for acceptance of the faith as,
he believed, the Church of his day had learned it from the
apostles. Phrases such as, “We have learned,” “We have
received,” “It has been handed down,” occur with surprising
frequency in the First Apology. It is not too hard to distinguish

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_232"/>  <strong>{Page 232}</strong> between what Justin presents as the Christian tradition and
his own efforts to interpret or explain. Thus the Sacred Name
that Christians venerated was clearly that of Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, into which they were baptized. Justin, doubtless
not uniquely, is making an effort to interpret this when he
says that Christians venerated, after God the Father and Lord
of all, his Son, and thirdly the holy prophetic Spirit.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p13.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p13.3"><sup class="Note">646</sup></a> Similarly in the Dialogue he tries to develop a formal doctrine of the
Word as a “second divine entity”
(<i>deuteros theos</i>). To him the
heart of Christianity is the Biblical message of God’s care and
love for man, as he found it both in the Bible (i.e., the Old
Testament) and in Jesus Christ. Behind the literary form of a
speech to the emperor, we are listening in the First Apology
to the kind of conversation that went on between Justin and
his visitors in the house of Martinus. Now he presents arguments about this or that (and the Apology could easily be
thrown into dialogue form), now he brings forward quotations
from the sacred text or refers to the increasingly venerated
writings of the apostles. But again and again the thread of
continuous argument is broken by the proclamation of the
basic kerygma of the Early Church, the message of the incarnate,
dying, risen, ascended Saviour and Lord.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p13.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p13.4"><sup class="Note">647</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p14">The First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho together
would serve as a convert’s shorter Bible, and such was doubtless
one of the purposes of Justin’s writing. His prospective readers
were, I suspect, not the noble or learned, but intelligent members
of what we may call the lower middle class. They were people who
were prepared to be impressed by mysterious words of Oriental
sages and who, if Justin had not taught them orthodox Christianity, would perhaps have been Marcionites or Mithraists.
His references to these sects suggest that these were immediate
rivals. Much of Justin’s history and exegesis no longer appeals.
But Christians can never renounce his central aim—to assert
their claim to be legitimate heirs of “the hope of Israel.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p14.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p14.1"><sup class="Note">648</sup></a> In detail, Justin sometimes seems to quote from memory,
sometimes to be using a collection of Biblical testimonies, one
cause or the other producing the startling combinations and
centos found in some of his quotations. A good example of his
method is in chs. 50; 51, where he first quotes <a class="scripRef" id="x.ii.i-p14.3">Isa. 53:12</a>
quite loosely, doubtless from memory, and then looks up the whole
passage and copies it out. The authority of the New Testament
books for Justin was that of the truths they contained. They

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_233"/>  <strong>{Page 233}</strong> were records of the words and acts of Jesus; and so his references
are to the gospel story rather than to specific Gospels. For the
teachings of Christ he perhaps used a manual of instruction
(such as we find in the Didache) rather than the separate
Synoptic texts. Though the question has been disputed, he
certainly knew the Fourth Gospel, to which his references
become more frequent as he comes closer to the inner life of the
Church in the later chapters of the First Apology. He was
acquainted with the principal Pauline Epistles (probably
lesser ones too, which he does not happen to refer to); and the
Dialogue contains a specific reference to Revelation.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p14.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p14.4"><sup class="Note">649</sup></a> His references to the birth and Passion of Christ contain legendary
touches such as appear in apocryphal Gospels, but whether
he derived them from written sources is uncertain.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p15">Justin wore the philosopher’s cloak, and later tradition
speaks of him as “philosopher and martyr,” yet his speculative
interests were really secondary. All the more significant,
therefore, are his striking contributions to the intellectual
tradition of Christian thought. The idea of God’s Logos could
be found in a variety of sources. It was floating in the air of
popular Greek philosophy and Hellenistic Judaism, and had
become naturalized in Christian circles by the Prologue of the
Fourth Gospel. (The chief thing to remember about the word
“logos” is that it means everything except a single word—speech, design, argument, reason—therefore God’s thought,
plan, utterance, and so on.) Justin’s use of it is partly Biblical
and partly apologetic. The Logos being divine, and yet not the
Father himself, accounts both for the divinity which Christians
have found in Jesus, and by retrospect for the divine
appearances in the Old Testament. The Reason incarnate in Christ
is also the diffused reason that speaks in every man (Justin is not
deeply interested in the cosmic action of the Logos). Hence
everything good and true really is ours by right; in the Second
Apology this thought is developed more explicitly, adopting
the term, familiar to Stoics, of the “spermatic word,” the divine
force which, as it were, impregnated the universe.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p15.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p15.1"><sup class="Note">650</sup></a> Pregnant as Justin’s ideas were, they remained inchoate, and somewhat
crude and confused. Perhaps they are all the more suggestive
for that. It would be easy to make a long list of the points that
Justin does not clearly define because he did not have to. An
example is what kind of being the prophetic Spirit is, in view
<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_234"/>  <strong>{Page 234}</strong> of the fact that the Logos is also a Spirit,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p15.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p15.3"><sup class="Note">651</sup></a> and the Spirit speaks through the prophets the Word of God. Nor again does
Justin bother to state precisely how the Spirit and the Logos
are distinguished from the lesser angelic powers, who follow
the Son (pre-eminently God’s Angel), and who in one passage
are named between him and the prophetic Spirit.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p15.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p15.4"><sup class="Note">652</sup></a> Certainly Justin knows that God is the only Fashioner of the universe,
who made it out of formless matter. But he seems to have no
interest in where that came from. Perhaps he could conceive
of nothing more nonexistent.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p15.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p15.5"><sup class="Note">653</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p16">A topic in which he was more interested than his modern
readers was the nature and activity of demons. In Later Platonism and popular Greek thought the <i>daimōnes</i> were intermediate
beings. They were more than man but far beneath the supreme
deity, and were often thought of as occupying the changeable
heavens between the earth and the moon. The word “demon”
itself was morally neutral; Justin regularly adds a qualifying
adjective when he uses it in a bad sense. He shared the Jewish
position that any such beings could only be fallen angels. In
the Second Apology he amplifies the references in the First<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p16.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p16.1"><sup class="Note">654</sup></a> by recounting the legend that angels who had been placed in
charge of mankind had sinned with women and begotten demons.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p16.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p16.2"><sup class="Note">655</sup></a> That pagan worship was in fact offered to demons
is an idea as old as Saint Paul.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p16.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p16.4"><sup class="Note">656</sup></a> But Justin develops it more in
detail when he declares that demons actually appeared to men,
performed some of the actions recounted in the myths, and
demanded worship as gods. Part of the atmosphere of early
Christianity was the sense that paganism represented invisible
as well as visible foes, and that hostile forces infested even the air.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p16.6" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p16.6"><sup class="Note">657</sup></a> Justin shows much more practical interest in demons
than in the good angelic powers, who, after all, were but
ministering spirits of the Lord. As in the traditional baptismal
service to this day, on entering the Church one renounced the
devil and all his works, and in that fellowship the great serpent
and the other demons were no longer to be feared.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p17">Justin the philosopher was also, and more deeply, Justin the
churchman. His description of baptism and the Eucharist
is the best-known section of his work, though it is introduced
<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_235"/>  <strong>{Page 235}</strong> rather incidentally, to assure readers that no nameless horrors are perpetrated at Christian gatherings. What strikes the reader who comes to this section from the rest of the Apology is that here he meets the Church’s technical terminology, which Justin partly uses, partly explains, partly paraphrases. Hence his threefold repetition of “rebirth” in one sentence to explain that Baptism is a sacrament of regeneration. Then there are phrases like: “Those whom we call deacons,” “This food we call Eucharist,” and “The president of the brethren.” In the last instance Justin might just as well have said “bishop.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p17.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p17.1"><sup class="Note">658</sup></a> The sacred language of rebirth in baptism<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p17.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p17.2"><sup class="Note">659</sup></a> and spiritual nourishment by the body and blood of Christ was evidently already well established. Even the rather complex devotional and theological comments that Justin offers are presented as part of the received tradition. The Eucharistic teaching of the Apology is completed by that of the Dialogue. It speaks of the Christian sacrifice of the bread and cup of the Eucharist, fulfilling Malachi’s prophecy of the pure ofIering of the Gentiles. It also gives the most complete of Justin’s several summaries of the contents of the Eucharistic prayer:</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p18">“We give thanks to God for having created the world with all that is in it for the sake of man, and for having freed us from the vice in which we lived, and for having completely brought to naught the principalities and powers, through Him who became subject to suffering according to his will.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p18.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p18.1"><sup class="Note">660</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p19">Justin’s religion was certainly deeper and richer than some of his formal arguments for it. The Apologist is always in danger of conceding too much for the sake of argument. Justin at times seems to say that Christ was merely on the same level as the sons of Zeus, an impression that he corrects elsewhere.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p19.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p19.1"><sup class="Note">661</sup></a> Nor does he really mean, I am sure, that he believed in Christ only because the prophecies fitted. Though he does not precisely describe either the need or the means of redemption, surely his faith is shown in such a simple phrase as, “For the

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_236"/>  <strong>{Page 236}</strong> salvation of those who believe in him . . . (he) endured . . .
suffering so that by dying and rising again he might conquer death.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p19.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p19.2"><sup class="Note">662</sup></a> Formally Justin presents a simple doctrine of free will which would suggest that the only salvation man would need is information, and the removal of the obstacles
interposed by the demons. But as incidental references show, he is well enough aware that it is only by the gift of God that men are able to understand his truth. Equally does he recognize that the Christian life is a life of thanksgiving for the gifts of God.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p19.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p19.3"><sup class="Note">663</sup></a></p>
      <h4 id="x.ii.i-p19.4">Style and Outline</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p20">Justin’s technique is, like his theology, practical. He could pay attention to literary form, but was much more interested in what he had to say than in just how he said it. He knew how to write an oration, a dialogue, or an epistle, but did not let
attention to those details stand in the way of the exposition of his message. His Greek is good, though not purist; he seems to apologize for an occasional colloquialism, even slightly for the straightforward Greek of the Gospels.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p20.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p20.1"><sup class="Note">664</sup></a> His sentences sometimes get out of control, either because he crowds in more ideas
than he intended to or because a central point in the argument is so clearly implied that he does not pause to state it.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.i-p20.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.i-p20.2"><sup class="Note">665</sup></a> The effort to find a clear outline in the First Apology has baffled commentators, especially since the scheme apparently announced in ch. 23 is hard to follow through in detail. But the central point in any analysis is the demonstration from the Old Testament that Jesus is the promised Messiah. This theme occupies chs. 30 to 53. It is possible to see a rhetorical scheme of approach to this theme and then return from it to the point of departure, somewhat as follows:</p>
      <div style="margin-left:.25in;" id="x.ii.i-p20.3">
<p class="List1" id="x.ii.i-p21"><b>A</b>  Plea for a Fair Hearing, chs. 1 to 8</p>
<p class="List2" id="x.ii.i-p22"><b>B</b>  The Faith and Life of Christians, chs. 9 to 20</p>
<p class="List3" id="x.ii.i-p23"><b>C</b>  Superiority of Christianity to Paganism, chs 21 to 29</p>
<p class="List4" id="x.ii.i-p24"><b>D </b> The Argument from Prophecy, chs. 30 to 53.</p>
<p class="List3" id="x.ii.i-p25"><b>E</b>  Paganism an Imitation of Christianity, chs. 54 to 60.</p>
<p class="List2" id="x.ii.i-p26"><b>F</b>  Christian Worship, chs. 61 to 67.</p>
<p class="List1" id="x.ii.i-p27"><b>G</b>  Conclusion, ch. 68</p>
</div>
      <span class="pb" id="x.ii.i-Page_237"/>  <strong>{Page 237}</strong> 
      <p class="Continue" id="x.ii.i-p28">There are hints of the general scheme in chs. 12 and 23; the
first announces that there will be not only defense, as in the
opening (and closing) sections, but attack, and the three
points announced in ch. 23 are approximately those of C, D,
and E. The closing sections interlock with the previous ones,
with a number of cross references. Several of the transitions
are prepared with some care. Chapter 20, for instance, looks
forward to the topic taken up in ch. 21. Chapter 53 similarly
looks forward to ch. 54. As is suitable for a work in the form of.
a forensic speech, the Conclusion is a brief summary and plea,
followed by citation of a supporting document.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.i-p29">The careful reader of Justin cannot call him a genius, but
comes to enjoy the company of the man who appears through
his writings, and to welcome his occasional moments of brilliant
insight. To the history of Christian thought he made a great
contribution. To him as much as to any other we may owe it
that the gospel has remained rooted in the religion of the Old
Testament, and on one basis or another has not been unfriendly
to human thought. His influence is clear in Athenagoras and
Irenaeus, as well as in his rather unworthy disciple Tatian.</p>

too freely by some editors. The first printed edition was that of

Eusebius knew that Justin wrote two Apologies, but seems to quote from
both of the preserved ones as the First. It may be that our Second Apology
is a mere supplement to the First, and that Justin’s Second, if there was
one, is now lost. I think, however, it is more likely that the Second,
which begins very abruptly, lost its opening in an early MS. and then

      <h4 id="x.ii.iii-p1.2">Plea for a Fair Hearing</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p2">1. To the Emperor Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius Augustus Caesar, and to Verissimus his son, the Philosopher, and to Lucius the Philosopher, son of Caesar by nature and of Augustus<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p2.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p2.1"><sup class="Note">668</sup></a> by adoption, a lover of culture, and to the Sacred Senate and the whole Roman people—on behalf of men of every nation who are unjustly hated and reviled, I,
Justin, son of Priscus and grandson of Bacchius, of Flavia Neapolis in Syria Palestina, being myself one of them, have drawn up this plea and petition.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p3">2. Reason requires that those who are truly pious and philosophers should honor and cherish the truth alone, scorning merely to follow the opinions of the ancients, if they are worthless. Nor does sound reason only require that one should not follow those who do or teach what is unjust; the lover of truth ought to choose in every way, even at the cost of his own life, to speak and do what is right, though death should take him away. So do you, since you are called pious and philosophers
and guardians of justice and lovers of culture, at least give us a hearing—and it will appear if you are really such.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p3.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p3.1"><sup class="Note">669</sup></a> For in these pages we do not come before you with flattery, or as if
making a speech to win your favor, but asking you to give judgment according to strict and exact inquiry—not, moved by prejudice or respect for superstitious men, or by irrational

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_243"/>  <strong>{Page 243}</strong> impulse and long-established evil rumor, giving a vote which would really be against yourselves. For we are firmly convinced that we can suffer no evil unless we are proved to be evildoers or shown to be criminals. You can kill us, but cannot do us
any real harm.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p3.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p3.3"><sup class="Note">670</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p4">3. But so that no one may think that this is an unreasonable and presumptuous utterance, we ask that the charges against us be investigated. If they are shown to be true, [let us] be punished as is proper.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p4.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p4.1"><sup class="Note">671</sup></a> But if nobody has proofs against us, true reason does not allow [you] to wrong innocent men because of an evil rumor—or rather [to wrong] yourselves when
you decide to pass sentence on the basis of passion rather than judgment. Every honorable man will recognize this as a fair challenge, and only just, that subjects should give a straightforward account of their life and thought, and that rulers
similarly should give their decision as followers of piety and philosophy, not with tyrannical violence. From this both rulers and subjects would gain. As one of the ancients said somewhere, “Unless both rulers and those they rule become lovers of
wisdom cities cannot prosper.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p4.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p4.2"><sup class="Note">672</sup></a> It is for us, therefore, to offer to all the opportunity of inspecting our life and teachings, lest we ourselves should bear the blame for what those who do not
really know about us do in their ignorance. But it is for you, as reason demands, to give [us] a hearing and show yourselves good judges. For if those who learn [the truth] do not do what is right, they have no defense before God.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p5">4. The mere ascription of a name means nothing, good or bad, except for the actions connected with the name. Indeed as far as the name charged against us goes, we are very gracious people.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p5.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">673</sup></a> But we do not think it right to ask for a pardon because of the name if we are proved to be criminals—and on the other hand, if neither the appellation of the name nor our
conduct shows us to be wrongdoers, you must face the problem whether in punishing unjustly men against whom nothing is proved you will yourselves owe a penalty to justice. Neither
<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_244"/>  <strong>{Page 244}</strong> reward nor punishment should follow from a name unless
something admirable or evil can actually be shown about it.
Among yourselves you do not penalize the accused before
conviction; but with us you take the name as proof, although,
as far as the name goes, you ought rather to punish our accusers.
For we are accused of being Christians; and it is not right to
hate graciousness. Again, if one of the accused denies the
charge, saying he is not [a Christian], you dismiss him, as
having no proof of misconduct against him; but if he confesses
that he is one, you punish him because of his confession. You
ought rather to investigate the life of the confessor and the
renegade, so that it would appear from their actions what sort
of person each is. There are those who, learning from Christ
their teacher, when they are put to the test encourage others
not to deny him—and similarly others whose bad conduct
gives some excuse to those who like to accuse all Christians
of godlessness and crime. This is entirely improper. There are
those who assume the name and costume of philosophers, but
do nothing worthy of their profession—as you know, men
among the ancients who held and taught opposite views are
included under the one name of philosophers. Some of them
even taught godlessness, and those who became poets proclaim
the impurity of Zeus, with his own children. And you do not
restrain those among you who follow such teachings, but even
offer prizes and honors to those who thus in beautiful words
insult them [the gods].</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p6">5. What can all this mean? You do not make judicial
inquiries in our case, though we are bound neither to commit
crimes nor to hold such godless ideas. Instead, you punish us
injudicially without deliberation, driven by unreasoning
passion and the whips of evil demons. The truth must be told.
In old times evil demons manifested themselves, seducing
women, corrupting boys, and showing terrifying sights to men—so
that those who did not judge these occurrences rationally
were filled with awe. Taken capture by fear and not understanding
that these were evil demons, they called them gods and
gave each of them the name which each of the demons had
chosen for himself. When Socrates tried by true reason and with
due inquiry to make these things clear and to draw men away
from the demons, they, working through men who delighted
in wickedness, managed to have him put to death as godless
and impious, saying that he was bringing in new divinities.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p6.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">674</sup></a>

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_245"/>  <strong>{Page 245}</strong> And now they do the same kind of thing to us. For these errors were not only condemned among the Greeks by reason, through Socrates, but among the barbarians, by Reason himself, who took form and became man and was called Jesus Christ. In obedience to him we say that the demons who do such things
are not only not rightly called gods,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p6.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p6.2"><sup class="Note">675</sup></a> but are in fact evil and unholy demons, whose actions are in no way like those of men who long after virtue.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p7">6. So, then, we are called godless. We certainly confess that we are godless with reference to beings like these who are commonly thought of as gods, but not with reference to the most true God, the Father of righteousness and temperance and the other virtues, who is untouched by evil. Him, and the Son who came from him, and taught us these things, and the army of the other good angels who follow him and are made like him, and the prophetic Spirit we worship and adore,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p7.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p7.1"><sup class="Note">676</sup></a> giving honor in reason and truth, and to everyone who wishes to learn transmitting [the truth] ungrudgingly as we have been taught.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p8">7. But someone will say, “Some [Christians], have been arrested and convicted as criminals.” Many at various times, perhaps, if you examine in each case the conduct of those who are accused; but do not condemn [all] because of those previously convicted. We admit in general that just as among the Greeks those who teach what seems best to them are all listed under the name of philosophy, even though their teachings are contradictory, so the name which is now being attacked is common to those among the barbarians who are and those who appear to be wise. They are all listed as Christians. So we ask that the actions of those who are denounced to you be investigated, in order that whoever is convicted may be punished as a criminal, but not as a Christian, and that whoever is shown to be innocent may be freed, committing no crime by being a Christian. We shall not ask you, however, to punish our accusers, for they suffer enough from their own wickedness and their ignorance of the good.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p9">8. Consider that we have said these things for your sake,

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_246"/>  <strong>{Page 246}</strong> since when put to trial we can deny [that we are Christians]—but we do not wish to live by telling a lie. For, longing for the life which is eternal and pure, we strive to dwell with God, the Father and Fashioner of all things. We are eager to confess,
being convinced and believing that those who have shown to God by their actions that they follow him and long to dwell with him, where no evil can disturb, are able to obtain these things. It is this, in brief, that we look for, and have learned from Christ, and teach. Plato similarly said that Rhadamanthus and Minos would punish the wicked who came before them.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p9.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p9.1"><sup class="Note">677</sup></a> We say that this is what will happen, but at the hands of Christ—and to the same bodies, reunited with their souls, and destined for eternal punishment, not for a five-hundred-year period only, as he said. If anyone says that this is unbelievable
or impossible—at least the mistake affects us and no one else,
as long as we are not convicted of any actual crime.</p>
      <h4 id="x.ii.iii-p9.2">The Faith  and Life of Christians</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p10">9. Certainly we do not honor with many sacrifices and floral garlands the objects that men have fashioned, set up in temples, and called gods. We know that they are lifeless and dead and do not represent the form of God—for we do not think of God
as having the kind of form which some claim that they imitate to be honored—but rather exhibit the names and shapes of the evil demons who have manifested themselves [to men]. You know well enough without our mentioning it how the
craftsmen prepare their material, scraping and cutting and molding and beating. And often they make what they call gods out of vessels used for vile purposes, changing and transforming by art merely their appearance. We consider it not only irrational but an insult to God, whose glory and form are ineffable, to give his name to corruptible things which themselves need care. You are well aware that craftsmen in these [things] are impure and—not to go into details—given to all kinds of vice; they even corrupt their own slave girls who work along with them. What an absurdity, that dissolute men should be spoken of as fashioning or remaking gods for public
veneration, and that you should appoint such people as guardians of the temples where they are set up—not considering that it is unlawful to think or speak of men as guardians of gods.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_247"/>  <strong>{Page 247}</strong> 
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p11">10. But we have learned<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p11.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p11.1"><sup class="Note">678</sup></a> [from our tradition] that God has no need of material offerings from men, considering that he is the provider of all. We have been taught and firmly believe that he accepts only those who imitate the good things which are his—temperance and righteousness and love of mankind, and whatever else truly belongs to the God who is called by
no given name. We have also been taught that in the beginning he in his goodness formed all things that are for the sake of men out of unformed matter, and if they show themselves by their actions worthy of his plan, we have learned that they will be counted worthy of dwelling with him, reigning together and made free from corruption and suffering. For as he made us in the beginning when we were not, so we hold that those who choose what is pleasing to him will, because of that choice,
be counted worthy of incorruption and of fellowship [with him]. We did not bring ourselves into being—but as to following after the things that are dear to God, choosing, them by the rational powers which he has given us—this is a matter of
conviction and leads us to faith. We hold it to be for the good of all men that they are not prevented from learning these things, but are even urged to [consider] them. For what human laws could not do, that the Word, being divine, would have brought about, if the evil demons had not scattered abroad many false and godless accusations, with the help of the evil desire that is in every man by nature [and expresses itself] in all kinds of ways.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p11.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p11.4"><sup class="Note">679</sup></a> None of this, however, matters to us.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p12">11. When you hear that we look for a kingdom, you rashly suppose that we mean something merely human. But we speak of a Kingdom with God, as is clear from our confessing Christ when you bring us to trial, though we know that death is the
penalty for this confession. For if we looked for a human kingdom we would deny it in order to save our lives, and would try to remain in hiding in order to obtain the thing we look for. But since we do not place our hopes on the present [order], we are not troubled by being put to death, since we will have to die somehow in any case.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p13">12. We are in fact of all men your best helpers and allies in securing good order,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p13.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p13.1"><sup class="Note">680</sup></a> convinced as we are that no wicked

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_248"/>  <strong>{Page 248}</strong> man, no covetous man or conspirator, or virtuous man either, can be hidden from God, and that everyone goes to eternal punishment or salvation in accordance with the character of his actions. If all men knew this, nobody would choose vice
even for a little time, knowing that he was on his way to eternal punishment by fire; every man would follow the self-restrained and orderly path of virtue, so as to receive the good things that come from God and avoid his punishments. There
are some who merely try to conceal their wrongdoing because of the laws and punishments which you decree, knowing that since you are only men it is possible for wrongdoers to escape you; if they learned and were convinced that our thoughts as well as our actions cannot be hidden from God they would certainly lead orderly lives, if only because of the consequences; as you must agree. But it seems as if you were afraid of having all men well-behaved, and nobody left for you to punish; this
would be the conduct of public executioners, not of good rulers. Such things, we are convinced, are brought about by the evil demons, the ones who demand sacrifices and service from men who live irrationally; but we have not learned [to expect] any unreasonable conduct from you, who aim at piety and philosophy. But if like thoughtless men you prefer custom to truth, then go ahead and do what you can. Rulers who respect reputation rather than truth have as much power as brigands
in a desert. The Word himself has shown that you will not succeed, and after God who begat him we know of no ruler more royal or more just than he. For just as all men try to avoid inheriting the poverty or sufferings or disgrace of their ancestors, so the sensible man will not choose whatever the Word forbids to be chosen. He foretold that all these things would happen—our Teacher, I mean, who is the Son and
Apostle of God the Father and Master of all, that is, Jesus Christ, from whom we have received the name of Christians. We are sure that all the things taught by him are so, since we see that what he predicted is actually coming to pass. This is God’s work, to announce something before it happens and then to show it happening as predicted. I might stop here and add no more, having made clear that we ask for what is just and true. But though I know that it is not easy to change
over at once a mind which is bound down by ignorance, I am encouraged to add somewhat to persuade the lover of truth, being sure that one can dispel
ignorance by putting truth against it.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_249"/>  <strong>{Page 249}</strong> 
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p14">13. What sound-minded man will not admit that we are not godless, since we worship the Fashioner of the universe, declaring him, as we have been taught, to have no need of blood and libations and incense, but praising him by the word
of prayer and thanksgiving for all that he has given us? We have learned that the only honor worthy of him is, not to consume by fire the things he has made for our nourishment, but to devote them to our use and those in need, in thankfulness to
him sending up solemn prayers and hymns for our creation and all the means of health, for the variety of creatures and the changes of the seasons, and sending up our petitions that we may live again in incorruption through our faith in him.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p14.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">681</sup></a> It is Jesus Christ who has taught us these things, having been born for this purpose and crucified under Pontius Pilate, who was procurator in Judea in the time of Tiberius Caesar. We will show that we honor him in accordance with reason, having
learned that he is the Son of the true God himself, and holding him to be in the second place and the prophetic Spirit in the third rank. It is for this that they charge us with madness, saying that we give the second place after the unchanging and
ever-existing God and begetter of all things to a crucified man, not knowing the mystery involved in this, to which we ask you to give your attention as we expound it.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p15">14. We warn you in advance to be careful, lest the demons whom we have attacked should deceive you and prevent your completely grasping and understanding what we say. For they struggle to have you as their slaves and servants, and now by manifestations in dreams, now by magic tricks, they get hold of all who do not struggle to their utmost for their own salvation—as we do who, after being persuaded by the Word, renounced them<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p15.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p15.1"><sup class="Note">682</sup></a> and now follow the only unbegotten God through his Son. Those who once rejoiced in fornication now delight in continence alone; those who made use of magic arts
have dedicated themselves to the good and unbegotten God; we who once took most pleasure in the means of increasing our wealth and property now bring what we have into a common fund and share with everyone in need; we who hated and killed
one another and would not associate with men of different tribes because of [their different] customs, now after the manifestation of Christ live together and pray for our enemies and

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_250"/>  <strong>{Page 250}</strong> try to persuade those who unjustly hate us, so that they, living according to the fair commands of Christ, may share with us the good hope of receiving the same things [that we will] from God, the master of all. So that this may not seem to be sophistry,
I think fit before giving our demonstration to recall a few of the teachings which have come from Christ himself. It is for you then, as mighty emperors, to examine whether we have been taught and do teach these things truly. His sayings were short and concise, for he was no sophist, but his word was the power of God.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p16">15. About continence he said this: “Whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery in his heart before God.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p16.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">683</sup></a> And: “If your right eye offends you, cut it out; it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with one eye than with two to be sent into eternal fire.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p16.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p16.3"><sup class="Note">684</sup></a> And: “Whoever marries a woman who has been put away from another man commits adultery.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p16.6" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p16.6"><sup class="Note">685</sup></a> And: “There are some who were made eunuchs by men, and some who were born eunuchs, and some who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake; only not all [are able to] receive this.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p16.9" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p16.9"><sup class="Note">686</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p17">And so those who make second marriages according to
human law are sinners in the sight of our Teacher,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p17.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p17.1"><sup class="Note">687</sup></a> and those who look on a woman to lust after her. For he condemns not only the man who commits the act of adultery, but the man who desires to commit adultery, since not only our actions but our thoughts are manifest to God. Many men and women now in their sixties and seventies who have been disciples of Christ from childhood have preserved their purity; and I am proud that I could point to such people in every nation. Then what shall we say of the uncounted multitude of those who have
turned away from incontinence and learned these things? For Christ did not call the righteous or the temperate to repentance, but the ungodly and incontinent and unrighteous. So he said: “I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_251"/>  <strong>{Page 251}</strong> repentance.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p17.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p17.2"><sup class="Note">688</sup></a> For the Heavenly Father wishes the repentance of a sinner rather than his punishment.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p18">This is what he taught on affection for all men: “If you love those who love you, what new thing do you do? for even the harlots do this. But I say to you, Pray for your enemies and love those who hate you and bless those who curse you and pray for
those who treat you despitefully.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p18.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p18.1"><sup class="Note">689</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p19">That we should share with those in need and do nothing for [our] glory he said these things: “Give to everyone who asks and turn not away him who wishes to borrow. For if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what new thing do
you do? Even the publicans do this.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p19.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p19.1"><sup class="Note">690</sup></a> But as for you, do not lay up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust

you as emperors and rulers of men, and praying that along with your imperial power you may also be found to have a sound mind.

abilities which he has received from God, as Christ told us when he said, “To whom God has given more, from him more will be required.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p26.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p26.5"><sup class="Note">705</sup></a></p>

lived, and eternal punishment awaits, do not fail to be convinced and believe that these things are true. For the oracles of the dead and the revelations of innocent children, the invoking of [departed] human souls, the dream senders and guardians of the magi, and what is done by those who know about such things—all this should convince you that souls are still conscious after death. Then there are the men who are seized and torn by the spirits of the dead, whom everyone calls demon-possessed and maniacs, and the oracles so well-known among you, of Amphilochus and Dodona and Pytho, and any others of that kind, and the teaching of writers, Empedocles and Pythagoras, Plato and Socrates, and the ditch in Homer
and the descent of Odysseus to visit the dead,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p27.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p27.1"><sup class="Note">706</sup></a> and other stories like this. Treat us at least like these; we believe in God not less than they do, but rather more, since we look forward to

flesh? Consider this hypothesis; if you were not such as you are, born of such parents, and someone were to show you the human seed and a picture of a man, and assure you that the one could grow into the other, would you believe it before you saw it happening? No one would dare to deny [that you wouldn’t].
In the same way unbelief prevails about the resurrection of the dead because you have never seen an instance of it. But as you at first would not have believed that from a little drop such beings [as men] could develop, yet you see it happening, so
consider that it is possible for human bodies, dissolved and scattered in the earth like seeds, to rise again in due time by God’s decree and be clothed with incorruption.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p28.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p28.1"><sup class="Note">707</sup></a> I cannot imagine how any adequate concept of divine power can be held by those who say that everything returns into that from which it came and that not even God can do anything more than this.

it possible for such creatures as they are to have come into being, yet they see themselves as they are, and indeed the whole world [as it is], and what they were made from. We have learned that it is better to believe things impossible to our own
nature and to men than to disbelieve like others, since we know that our Teacher Jesus Christ said, “The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p28.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p28.3"><sup class="Note">708</sup></a> And: “Fear not those who put you to death and after that can do no more, but

whom you honor, and on others [teach] more completely and more worthily of God, and are the only ones who offer proof, why are we above all hated unjustly? When we say that all things have been ordered and made by God we appear to
offer the teaching of Plato—in speaking of a coming destruction by fire, that of the Stoics; in declaring that the souls of the unrighteous will be punished after death, still remaining in conscious existence, and those of the virtuous, delivered from
punishments, will enjoy happiness, we seem to agree with [various] poets and philosophers; in declaring that men ought not to worship the works of their hands we are saying the same things as the comedian Menander and others who have said

In saying that the Word, who is the first offspring of God, was born for us without sexual union, as Jesus Christ our Teacher, and that he was crucified and died and after rising again ascended into heaven we introduce nothing new beyond [what you say of] those whom you call sons of Zeus. You know how many sons of Zeus the writers whom you honor speak of—Hermes, the hermeneutic Word and teacher of all<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p30.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p30.1"><sup class="Note">712</sup></a>; Asclepius, who was also a healer and after being struck by lightning ascended into heaven—as did Dionysus who was torn in pieces; Heracles, who to escape his torments threw himself into the fire; the Dioscuri born of Leda and Perseus of Danae; and Bellerophon who, though of human origin, rode on the [divine] horse Pegasus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p30.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p30.2"><sup class="Note">713</sup></a> Need I mention Ariadne and those who like her are said to have been placed among the stars? and what of your deceased emperors, whom you regularly think worthy

kind of actions are related of each of those who are called sots
of Zeus, except [to point out] that they are recorded for the
benefit and instruction of students—for all consider it a fine
thing to be imitators of the gods.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p30.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p30.4"><sup class="Note">715</sup></a> Far be it from every sound
mind to entertain such a concept of the deities as that Zeus,
whom they call the ruler and begetter of all, should have been
a parricide and the son of a parricide, and that moved by
desire of evil and shameful pleasures he descended on Ganymede and the many women whom he seduced, and that his
sons after him were guilty of similar actions. But, as we said
before, it was the wicked demons who did these things. We have
been taught that only those who live close to God in holiness
and virtue attain to immortality, and we believe that those
who live unjustly and do not reform will be punished in eternal
fire.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p31">22. Now if God’s Son, who is called Jesus, were only an
ordinary man, he would be worthy because of his wisdom to be
called Son of God, for all authors call God father of men and
gods. When we say, as before, that he was begotten by God
as the Word of God in a unique manner beyond ordinary birth,
this should be no strange thing for you who speak of Hermes
as the announcing word from God. If somebody objects that
he was crucified, this is in common with the sons of Zeus, as
you call them, who suffered, as previously listed. Since their
fatal sufferings are narrated as not similar but different, so his
unique passion should not seem to be any worse—indeed I
will, as I have undertaken, show, as the argument proceeds,
that he was better; for he is shown to be better by his actions.
If we declare that he was born of a virgin, you should consider
this something in common with Perseus. When we say that he
healed the lame, the paralytic, and those born blind,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p31.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p31.1"><sup class="Note">716</sup></a> and raised the dead, we seem to be talking about things like those
said to have been done by Asclepius.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p32">23. In order to make this clear to you I will present the
evidence that the things we say, as disciples of Christ and of the
prophets who came before him, are the only truths and older
than all the writers who have lived, and we ask to be accepted,



<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_257"/>  <strong>{Page 257}</strong> not because we say the same things as they do, but because
we are speaking the truth—[second] that Jesus Christ alone
was really begotten as Son of God, being his Word and First-begotten and Power, and becoming man by his will he taught
us these things for the reconciliation and restoration of the
human race—and [third] that before he came among men as
man, there were some who, on account of the already mentioned wicked demons, told through the poets as already having
occurred the myths they had invented, just as now they are
responsible for the slanders and godless deeds alleged against
us, of which there is neither witness nor demonstration.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p32.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p32.1"><sup class="Note">717</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p33">24. The first point is that though we say the same as do the
Greeks, we only are hated, because of the name of Christ. We
do no wrong but are put to death as offenders [because of our
worship, though] others everywhere worship trees and rivers,
mice and cats and crocodiles and many kinds of irrational
animals,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p33.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p33.1"><sup class="Note">718</sup></a> and the same objects are not honored by all, but
different ones in different places, so that all are impious to each
other, because of not having the same objects of worship. Yet this
is the one complaint you have against us, that we do not worship
the same gods that you do, and do not bring libations and
offerings of fat to the dead, crowns for their statues, and sacrifices. Yet, as you know well, the same beings are gods to some
and wild animals to others, while still others think of them as
sacred victims.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p34">25. Secondly, out of every race of men we who once worshiped Dionysus the son of Semele and Apollo the son of Leto,
who in their passion for men did things which it is disgraceful
even to speak of, or who worshiped Persephone and Aphrodite,
who were driven mad by [love of] Adonis and whose mysteries
you celebrate, or Asclepius or some other of those who are
called gods, now through Jesus Christ despise them, even at the
cost of death, and have dedicated ourselves to the unbegotten
and impassible God. We do not believe that he ever descended
in mad passion on Antiope or others, nor on Ganymede, nor
was he, receiving help through Thetis, delivered by that
hundred-handed monster, nor was he, because of this, anxious

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_258"/>  <strong>{Page 258}</strong> that Thetis’ son Achilles should destroy so many Greeks for the
sake of his concubine Briseis.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p34.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p34.1"><sup class="Note">719</sup></a> We pity those who believe [such
stories], for which we know that the demons are responsible.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p35">26. A third point is that after Christ’s ascent into heaven the
demons put forward various men who said that they were gods,
and you not only did not persecute them, but thought them
worthy of honors. One was a certain Simon, a Samaritan from
the village of Gitta, who in the time of Claudius Caesar,
through the arts of the demons who worked in him, did mighty
works of magic in your imperial city of Rome and was thought
to be a god. He has been honored among you as a god by a
statue, which was set up on the River Tiber, between the two
bridges, with this inscription in Latin, SIMONI DEO
SANCTO.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p35.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p35.1"><sup class="Note">720</sup></a> Almost all the Samaritans, and a few in other
nations, confess this man as their first god and worship him as
such, and a woman named Helena, who traveled around with
him in those days, and had formerly been a public prostitute,
they say was the first Concept produced from him. Then we
know of a certain Menander, who was also a Samaritan, from
the village of Capparetaea, who had been a disciple of Simon’s,
and was also possessed by the demons. He deceived many at
Antioch by magic arts, and even persuaded his followers that
he would never die; there are still some who believe this [as
they learned] from him. Then there is a certain Marcion of
Pontus, who is still teaching his converts that there is another
God greater than the Fashioner. By the help of the demons
he has made many in every race of men to blaspheme and to
deny God the Maker of the universe, professing that there is
another who is greater and has done greater things than he.
As we said, all who derive [their opinions] from these men are
called Christians, just as men who do not share the same teachings with the philosophers still have in common with them the
name of philosophy, thus brought into disrepute. Whether
they commit the shameful deeds about which stories are told—the upsetting of the lamp, promiscuous intercourse, and the
meals of human flesh,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p35.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p35.2"><sup class="Note">721</sup></a> we do not know; but we are sure that

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_259"/>  <strong>{Page 259}</strong> they are neither persecuted nor killed by you, on account of their teachings anyway. I have compiled and have on hand a treatise against all the heresies which have arisen, which I will give you if you would like to consult it.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p36">27. That we may avoid all injustice<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p36.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p36.1"><sup class="Note">722</sup></a> and impiety, we have been taught that to expose the newly born is the work of
wicked men—first of all because we observe that almost all [foundlings], boys as well as girls, are brought up for prostitution. As the ancients are said to have raised herds of oxen or goats or sheep or horses in their pastures, so now [you raise
children] just for shameful purposes, and so in every nation a crowd of females and hermaphrodites and doers of unspeakable deeds are exposed as public prostitutes. You even collect pay and levies and taxes from these, whom you ought to exterminate from your civilized world.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p36.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p36.2"><sup class="Note">723</sup></a> And anyone who makes use of them may in addition to [the guilt of] godless, impious, and intemperate intercourse, by chance be consorting with his own
child or relative or brother. Some even prostitute their own children and wives, and others are admittedly mutilated for purposes of sodomy, and treat this as part of the mysteries of the mother of the gods—while beside each of those whom you
think of as gods a serpent is depicted as a great symbol and mystery. You charge against us the actions that you commit openly and treat with honor, as if the divine light were overthrown and withdrawn—which of course does no harm to us, who refuse to do any of these things, but rather injures those who do them and then bring false witness [against us].</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p37">28. Among us the chief of the evil demons is called the serpent and Satan and the devil, as you can learn by examining our writings. Christ has foretold that he will be cast into fire with his host and the men who follow him, [all] to be punished
for endless ages. God delays doing this for the sake of the human race, for he foreknows that there are some yet to be saved by repentance, even perhaps some not yet born. In the beginning he made the race of men endowed with intelligence, able to choose the truth and do right, so that all men are without excuse before God, for they were made with the powers of reason and observation. Anyone who does not believe that God cares for these things either manages to profess that he does not
<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_260"/>  <strong>{Page 260}</strong> exist, or makes out that he exists but approves of evil or remains [unaffected] like a stone, and that virtue and vice are not realities, but that men consider things good or bad by opinion alone; this is the height of impiety and injustice.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p38">29. And again [we do not expose children] lest some of them, not being picked up, should die and we thus be murderers. But to begin with, we do not marry except in order to bring up children, or else, renouncing marriage, we live in perfect continence.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p38.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p38.1"><sup class="Note">724</sup></a> To show you that promiscuous intercourse is not among our mysteries just recently one of us submitted a petition to the Prefect Felix in Alexandria, asking that a physician be allowed to make him a eunuch, for the physicians there said they were not allowed to do this without the permission of the Prefect. When Felix would by no means agree to endorse [the petition], the young man remained single, satisfied with [the approval of] his own conscience and that of his fellow believers.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p38.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p38.2"><sup class="Note">725</sup></a> I think it proper in this connection to remind you of the recent case of Antinous, whom everybody, through fear, hastened to worship as a god, though knowing

      <h4 id="x.ii.iii-p38.6">The Argument  from Prophecy</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p39">30. But lest someone should argue against us, What excludes [the supposition] that this person whom you call Christ was a man, of human origin, and did these miracles you speak of by magic arts, and so appeared to be God’s Son?—we will
bring forward our demonstration. We do not trust in mere hearsay, but are forced to believe those who prophesied [these things] before they happened, because we actually see things that have happened and are happening as was predicted. This
will, as we think, be the greatest and surest demonstration for you too.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p40">31. There were among the Jews certain men who were prophets of God, through whom the prophetic Spirit announced in advance events that were to occur. The successive rulers of the Jews carefully preserved their prophecies, as they were
spoken when they prophesied, in their own Hebrew language,

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_261"/>  <strong>{Page 261}</strong> [and] as arranged in books by the prophets themselves. When
Ptolemy, king of Egypt, was founding a library, and set out
to gather the writings of all mankind, he learned about these
prophecies and sent to Herod, then king of the Jews, asking
him to send him the prophetic books. King Herod sent them,
written in the aforementioned Hebrew language. Since their
contents were not intelligible to the Egyptians, he again sent
and asked him to send men who could translate them into
Greek.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p40.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p40.1"><sup class="Note">727</sup></a> This was done, and the books remain in the hands
of the Egyptians down to the present; the Jews everywhere
have them too. But though they read them, they do not understand what they say, but consider us their enemies and opponents, putting us to death or punishing us, as you do, whenever
they can, as you can realize—for in the Jewish War recently
past Bar-Cochba, the leader of the revolt of the Jews, ordered
Christians only to be subjected to terrible punishments, unless
they would deny Jesus the Christ and blaspheme [him].<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p40.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p40.3"><sup class="Note">728</sup></a> We find it predicted in the books of the prophets that Jesus our
Christ would come, born of a virgin, grown to manhood,
healing every sickness and every disease and raising the dead,
hated and unacknowledged and crucified, dying and rising
again and ascending into heaven, both really being and being
called Son of God. [We find also that] men sent by him would
proclaim these things to every race of mankind, and that men
of the Gentiles especially would believe in him. This was prophesied over five thousand years before he appeared, then
three thousand, and two thousand, and again one thousand,
and once more eight hundred [years before].<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p40.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p40.5"><sup class="Note">729</sup></a> For there were new prophets again and again as the generations passed.</p>

Thus Moses, who was the first of the prophets, said in these very words: “The ruler shall not depart from Judah, nor the governor from his thighs, until he come for whom it is reserved; and he shall be the expectation of the nations, binding his colt to the vine, washing his robe in the blood of the grape.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p41.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p41.1"><sup class="Note">730</sup></a> You can inquire precisely and learn up to whose time the Jews had their own ruler and king. [It was] until

the divine and holy prophetic Spirit through Moses, that a
ruler would not depart from the Jews until he should come for
whom the Kingdom is reserved. For Judah was the forefather
of the Jews, after whom they are called Jews; and after his
[Christ’s] appearance you began to rule over the Jews and
gained control of their whole land. The saying, He shall be
the expectation of the nations, is a testimony that men of
every nation will look forward to his coming again, as you can
clearly see and be convinced by the fact, for men of every race
are looking for him who was crucified in Judea, immediately
after which the land of the Jews fell to you as spoil of war.
Binding his foal to the vine and washing his robe in the blood
of the grape is a symbolic exhibition of the things that would
happen to Christ, and his actions. For an ass’s foal was standing
at the entrance of a village, bound to a vine,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p41.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p41.3"><sup class="Note">731</sup></a> which he then
ordered his companions to bring to him; when it was brought
he mounted and sat on it and entered into Jerusalem, where
was the great Temple of the Jews which you afterward overthrew. After this he was crucified, so as to fulfill the rest of the
prophecy. For washing his robe in the blood of the grape was
predictive of the Passion which he was to suffer, cleansing by
his blood those who believe on him. For the men who believe
on him in whom dwells the seed of God, the Word, are what the
divine Spirit through the prophet calls a garment. The blood
of the grape that was spoken of was a sign that he who was to
appear would have blood, though not from human seed but
by divine power. The first Power after God the Father and
Master of all, even [his] Son, is the Word—how he was made
flesh and became man we shall describe below. As the blood of
the grape was not made by man, but by God, so it was testified,
that [his] blood should not come from human seed, but from
divine power, as we said before. Isaiah, another prophet,
prophesying the same things in other words, said: “A star shall
rise out of Jacob, and a flower will come forth from the root
of Jesse, and upon his arm will the nations hope.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p41.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p41.4"><sup class="Note">732</sup></a> The

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_263"/>  <strong>{Page 263}</strong> shining star has risen and the flower has grown from the root of Jesse—this is Christ. For he was by the power of God conceived by a virgin of the seed of Jacob, who was the father of Judah, the father of the Jews, as has been explained; Jesse was his
ancestor, according to the oracle, and he was the son of Jacob and Judah by lineal succession.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p42">33. And again, hear how it was literally prophesied by Isaiah that he would be born of a virgin. He said, “Behold, the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they will call his name, God with us.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p42.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p42.1"><sup class="Note">733</sup></a> For God testified in advance through the prophetic Spirit that things which are unbelievable and thought impossible among men would happen, so that when this should occur it would not be disbelieved, but received with faith because it had been predicted. Lest some, not understanding the prophecy which has been referred to, should bring against us the reproach that we bring against the poets who say that
Zeus came upon women for the sake of sexual pleasure, we will try to explain these words clearly. For “Behold, the Virgin shall conceive” means that the Virgin would conceive without intercourse. For if she had had intercourse with anyone, she
would not have been a virgin; but God’s power, coming upon the Virgin, overshadowed her, and caused her to conceive while still remaining a virgin. The angel of God who was sent to this Virgin at the time brought her this good news, saying, “Behold, you will conceive in the womb by a Holy Spirit and will bear a son; and he will be called Son of the Highest and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p42.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p42.4"><sup class="Note">734</sup></a> as those who recorded everything about our Saviour Jesus Christ have taught us. We believe them, since the prophetic Spirit through the above-mentioned Isaiah said
that this would happen, as we noted before. The Spirit and the Power from God cannot rightly be thought of as anything else than the Word, who is also the First-born of God, as Moses the above-mentioned prophet testified. So this [Spirit], coming upon the Virgin and overshadowing her, made her pregnant—not by intercourse, but by [divine] power.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p42.7" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p42.7"><sup class="Note">735</sup></a> The name Jesus in Hebrew means the same as Saviour in Greek, and so the angel said to the Virgin, “And you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” Even you will
<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_264"/>  <strong>{Page 264}</strong> agree, I think, that those who prophesied were inspired by none other than the divine Word.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p43">34. Hear also in what part of the earth he was to be born, as
another prophet, Micah, foretold. He said, “And you Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers
of Judah; for out of you will come a Ruler who will shepherd
my people.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p43.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p43.1"><sup class="Note">736</sup></a> This is a village in the land of the Jews, thirty-five stadia from Jerusalem, in which Jesus Christ was born, as you can learn from the census which was taken under Quirinius, who was your first procurator in Judea.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p43.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p43.4"><sup class="Note">737</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p44">35. How the Christ after his birth was to live hidden from other men until he grew to manhood, as also happened—hear the predictions that refer to this. There is this: “A child is born to us, and a young man is given to us, and the government will be upon his shoulders—”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p44.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p44.1"><sup class="Note">738</sup></a> testifying the power of the cross, which when crucified he took upon his shoulders, as will be shown more clearly as the argument proceeds. Again the same
prophet Isaiah, inspired by the prophetic Spirit, said: “I have stretched out my hands over a disobedient and contradicting people, over those who walk in a way that is not good. They now ask judgment of me and dare to draw near to God.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p44.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p44.3"><sup class="Note">739</sup></a> Again in other words he says through another prophet: “They pierced my hands and feet, and cast lots for my clothing.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p44.6" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p44.6"><sup class="Note">740</sup></a> Now David, the king and prophet, who said this, suffered none of these things. But Jesus Christ stretched out his hands when he was crucified by the Jews, who contradicted him and denied that he was Christ. As the prophet said, “They placed
him in mockery on the judgment seat and said, judge us.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p44.9" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p44.9"><sup class="Note">741</sup></a> “They pierced my hands and feet,” was an announcement of the nails that were fastened in his hands and feet on the cross.  After fastening him to the cross, those who crucified him cast lots for his clothing and divided it among themselves. That these things really happened, you can learn from the Acts of what was done under Pontius Pilate. And that it was distinctly prophesied that he would take his seat on the foal of an ass

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_265"/>  <strong>{Page 265}</strong> and so enter Jerusalem, we will quote the words of the prophecy of another prophet, Zephaniah, as follows: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold your King comes to you, meek, and riding upon an ass and a colt the foal of a donkey.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p44.11" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p44.11"><sup class="Note">742</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p45">36. When you hear the words of the prophets spoken as in a particular character, do not think of them as spoken by the inspired men themselves, but by the divine Word that moved them. For sometimes he speaks as predicting the things that are to happen, sometimes he speaks as in the character of God the Master and Father of all, sometimes as in the character of Christ, sometimes in the character of the people answering the Lord or his Father. You can see the same thing in your own
writers, where one man is the author of the whole work but introduces different characters in dialogue. Not understanding this, the Jews who are in possession of the books of the prophets did not recognize Christ even when he came, and they hate us who declare that he has come and show that he was crucified by them as had been predicted.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p46">37. So that you may see this clearly, here is the kind of words spoken in the character of the Father through the above-mentioned prophet Isaiah: “The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s crib, but Israel knows me not and my
people does not understand. Woe, sinful nation, people full of sins, wicked seed, lawless children, you have forsaken the Lord.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p46.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p46.1"><sup class="Note">743</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p47">Again in another place, where the same prophet speaks similarly for the Father: “What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p47.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p47.1"><sup class="Note">744</sup></a> And again elsewhere: “My soul hates your new moons and sabbaths, I cannot endure the great day of the fast, and [your] idleness; nor when you come to appear
before me will I hear you. Your hands are full of blood, and if you bring offerings of fine flour, [and] incense, it is an abomination to me; the fat of lambs and blood of bulls I do not wish. For who demanded this at your hands? But loose every bond of iniquity, tear apart the knots of the contracts of violence, cover the homeless and naked, deal out your bread

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_266"/>  <strong>{Page 266}</strong> to the hungry.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p47.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p47.3"><sup class="Note">745</sup></a> You can now notice the kind of things that were taught by the prophets as from God.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p48">38. When the prophetic Spirit speaks in the character of the Christ, he says, “I stretched out my hands over a disobedient and contradicting people, over those who walk in a way that is not good.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p48.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p48.1"><sup class="Note">746</sup></a> And again: “I have offered my back to scourges and my cheeks to blows, and I did not turn away my face from the shame of spittings. And the Lord became my helper, therefore I was not confounded, but set my face as a hard rock, and I knew that I would not be put to shame, for he who justifies me is at hand.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p48.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p48.3"><sup class="Note">747</sup></a> Again when he says: “They cast lots for my clothing, and pierced my feet and hands. I lay down and slept and rose up again, for the Lord supported me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p48.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p48.5"><sup class="Note">748</sup></a> Again when he says, “They spoke with their lips, they shook their heads, saying, Let him deliver himself.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p48.8" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p48.8"><sup class="Note">749</sup></a> All these things were done by the Jews to Christ, as you can learn. For when he was crucified they stuck out their lips and shook their heads, saying, “He who raised the dead, let him now save himself.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p48.10" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p48.10"><sup class="Note">750</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p49">39. When the prophetic Spirit speaks as prophesying things to come, he says: “For the law will go forth from Zion and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem, and he shall judge in the midst of the nations and rebuke much people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks, and nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p49.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p49.1"><sup class="Note">751</sup></a> We can show you that this has really happened. For a band of twelve men went forth
from Jerusalem, and they were common men, not trained in speaking, but by the power of God they testified to every race of mankind that they were sent by Christ to teach to all the Word of God; and [now] we who once killed each other not only do not make war on each other, but in order not to lie or deceive our inquisitors we gladly die for the confession of Christ. For it would be possible for us to follow the saying, “The tongue has sworn, the mind remains unsworn.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p49.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p49.4"><sup class="Note">752</sup></a> But it would be ridiculous when the soldiers whom you have recruited and enrolled stick to their loyalty to you<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p49.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p49.5"><sup class="Note">753</sup></a> before their own

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_267"/>  <strong>{Page 267}</strong> life and parents and native land and all their families, though you have nothing incorruptible to offer them, for us, who desire incorruption, not to endure all things in order to receive what we long for from Him who is able to give it.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p50">40. Hear now how predictions were made about those who were to proclaim his teaching and testify to his manifestation; for the above-mentioned prophet and king said this through the prophetic Spirit: “Day to day utters speech, and night to
night shows forth knowledge. There is no language or speech where their words are not heard. Their sound went out into all the earth, and their words to the end of the inhabited world. He set his tabernacle in the sun, and he himself, as a bridegroom
coming out of his chamber, will rejoice like a giant to run his course.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p50.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p50.1"><sup class="Note">754</sup></a> In addition to these I have thought it good and appropriate to mention some other prophetic words spoken through the same David, from which you may learn how the
prophetic Spirit exhorts men to live, and how he testifies of the conspiracy which was formed by Herod the king of the Jews and the Jews themselves and Pilate, who was your procurator among them, with his soldiers, against Christ. [He also testifies]
that he would be believed in by men of every race, and that God calls him his Son and has declared that he will subject his enemies to him, and how the demons try as far as they can to escape the power of God the Father and Master of all and that
of his Christ, and how God calls all men to repentance before the day of judgment comes. These words were as follows:<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p50.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p50.4"><sup class="Note">755</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p51">“Blessed is the man who has not walked in the council of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor taken his seat upon the seat of pestilence, but his will is in the law of the Lord, and in his law will he meditate day and night. And he shall be like the tree which is planted by the watercourses, which will give its fruit in its season, and his leaf will not wither, and whatever he does will be prospered. Not so are the ungodly, not so, but rather like the chaff which the wind blows away from the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly will not arise in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous, because the Lord knows the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly will be destroyed.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p52">
“Why have the nations raged and the peoples imagined new things?<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p52.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p52.1"><sup class="Note">756</sup></a> The kings of the earth stood up, and their rulers

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_268"/>  <strong>{Page 268}</strong> assembled together against the Lord and against his Christ,
saying, Let us break their bonds and let us cast away from us
their yoke. He that dwells in heaven will laugh them to scorn,
and the Lord will mock at them. Then will he speak to them
in his wrath and vex them in his anger. I have been set up by
him as king on Zion his holy mountain, proclaiming the Lord’s
decree. The Lord said to me, You are my Son, today
have I begotten you; ask of me and I will give you nations
for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession; you will shepherd them with a rod of iron, you will break
them like potter’s vessels. And now, O kings, understand; be
instructed, all you who judge the earth. Serve the Lord with
fear and rejoice before him with trembling. Accept discipline,
lest the Lord should be angry, [and] wrathful, and you be
destroyed from the right way when his anger is kindled in
haste. Blessed are all those who have put their trust in him.”</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p53">
41. And again in another prophecy the prophetic Spirit,
testifying through the same David that after being crucified
Christ would reign, said: “O sing to the Lord, all the earth,
and proclaim his salvation from day to day; for great is the
Lord and highly to be praised, terrible beyond all the gods.
For all the gods of the nations are images of demons, but God
made the heavens. Glory and praise are before him, and
strength and pride in the place of his sanctification. Give glory
to the Lord, the Father of the ages. Receive favor and go in
before his face and worship in his holy courts. Let all the earth
fear before him, and be set upright and not shaken. Let them
exult among the nations; the Lord has reigned from the tree.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p53.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p53.1"><sup class="Note">757</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p54">
42. Now when the prophetic Spirit speaks of things to come
as already having happened, as is illustrated in the passages
quoted—I will explain this too so that those who come on it
will have no excuse [for not understanding]. Things he fully
knows are to happen he speaks of in advance as if they had
already occurred. Give careful attention to the passages

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_269"/>  <strong>{Page 269}</strong> quoted [and you will see] that this is the way they must be
taken. David uttered the words quoted above fifteen hundred
years before Christ, made man, was crucified, and none of those
who were crucified before him gave joy to the nations, nor of
those [crucified] after him either. But in our time Jesus Christ,
who was crucified and died, rose again and, ascending into
heaven, began to reign; and on account of what was proclaimed
by the apostles in all nations as [coming] from him, there is
joy for those who look forward to the incorruption which he
has promised.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p55">43. So that none may infer from what we have said that the
events we speak of, because they were foreknown and predicted,
took place according to inevitable destiny—I can explain this
too. We have learned from the prophets, and declare as the
truth, that penalties and punishments and good rewards are
given according to the quality of each man’s actions. If this
were not so, but all things happened in accordance with
destiny, nothing at all would be left up to us. For if it is destined
that one man should be good and another wicked, then neither
is the one acceptable nor the other blameworthy. And if the
human race does not have the power by free choice to avoid
what is shameful and to choose what is right, then there is
no responsibility for actions of any kind. But that [man] walks
upright or falls by free choice we may thus demonstrate. We
[often] observe the same man in pursuit of opposite things. If
he were destined to be either wicked or virtuous, he would not
be thus capable of opposites, and often change his mind. Nor
would some be virtuous and others wicked, for then we would
have to declare fate to be the cause of evils and [at the same
time] to act in opposition to itself<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p55.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p55.1"><sup class="Note">758</sup></a>—or to accept as true the
opinion referred to above, that there is no real virtue or vice,
but only by opinion are things considered good or bad; which,
as the true Reason shows us, is the greatest impiety and wickedness. But we do say that deserved rewards are irrevocably
destined for those who have chosen the good, and likewise
their just deserts for those [who have chosen] the opposite.
But God did not make man like other [beings], such as trees
and animals, which have no power of choice. For he would not
be worthy of rewards or praise if he did not choose the good of
himself, but was so made, nor if he were evil would he justly

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_270"/>  <strong>{Page 270}</strong> deserve punishment, if he were not such of himself, but was
unable to be anything different from that for which he was
formed.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p56">44. The holy prophetic Spirit taught us these things, saying
through Moses that God said to the first-formed man, “Behold
I have set before you good and evil, choose the good.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p56.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p56.1"><sup class="Note">759</sup></a> And again through Isaiah, another prophet, this was said to the
same purpose, as from God the Father and Master of all things:
“Wash yourselves, be clean, take away wickednesses from your
souls, learn to do good, give judgment for the orphan and
defend the cause of the widow, and come and let us reason
together, says the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I
will make them as white as wool, and though they be like
crimson, I will make them as white as snow. And if you are
willing and listen to me, you will eat the good of the land;
but if you will not listen to me, the sword will devour you;
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p56.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p56.5"><sup class="Note">760</sup></a> The phrase, “The sword will devour you,” does not mean that the
disobedient will be slain by swords, but the sword of God is
the fire, of which those who choose to do what is evil are made
the fuel. Because of this he says, “A sword will devour you,
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.” For if he were speaking of a sword that cuts and at once destroys, he would not have
said, “Will devour.”</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p57">So when Plato said, “The blame belongs to him who chooses,
and God is free from blame,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p57.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p57.1"><sup class="Note">761</sup></a> he took this from the prophet
Moses. For Moses was earlier than Plato and all the Greek
writers. And everything that philosophers and poets said about
the immortality of the soul, punishments after death, contemplation of heavenly things, and teachings of that kind—they
took hints from the prophets and so were able to understand
these things and expounded them. So it seems that there were
indeed seeds of truth in all men, but they are proved not to have
understood them properly since they contradict each other.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p58">So when we say that things yet to happen have been prophesied, we do not say that they take place by inevitable destiny,
but since God foreknows what all men are to do, and it is his
decree that each will be rewarded according to the quality of his
actions, he foretells by the prophetic Spirit what he will do in
accordance with the quality of what they do. So he is ever leading the human race to reflection and remembrance, showing

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_271"/>  <strong>{Page 271}</strong> that he cares for it and provides for men. But by the working
of the wicked demons death has been decreed against those
who read the books of Hystaspes or Sybil or the prophets,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p58.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p58.1"><sup class="Note">762</sup></a> so that they might frighten people away from receiving the
knowledge of good things by consulting them, and keep them
in slavery to themselves. But they did not succeed in this forever, for we not only boldly consult these books, but also as
you see offer them for your inspection, being sure that what
they declare will be welcome to all. Even if we only persuade
a few, this will be a great gain for us; for as good husbandmen
we will receive our reward from our Master.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p58.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p58.2"><sup class="Note">763</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p59">45. Now hear how it was said through David the prophet,
that God the Father of all would take up Christ into heaven
after raising him from the dead, and then wait to smite the
demons who are his enemies, until the number be completed
of those whom he foreknows will be good and virtuous,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p59.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p59.1"><sup class="Note">764</sup></a> for
whose sake he has not yet brought about the destruction of the
world by fire. The words are these: “The Lord said to my Lord,
Sit on my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.
The Lord will send forth the rod of power from Jerusalem; and
dominate in the midst of your enemies. The beginning is with
you in the day of your power, in the splendors of your holy
ones; I have begotten you from the womb before the morning
star.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p59.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p59.2"><sup class="Note">765</sup></a> The phrase, “He will send forth the rod of power for
you from Jerusalem,” is a prediction of the mighty word which
his apostles, going forth from Jerusalem, preached everywhere,
and which, although death is decreed against those who teach
or even confess the name of Christ, we everywhere both receive
and teach. If you respond to these words with hostility, you
can do no more, as we said before, than to kill us, which will
not do harm to us, but will lead to eternal punishment through
fire for you and all who unjustly are enemies [to the gospel]
and do not repent.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p60">46. Lest some should unreasonably object, in order to turn
men away from what we teach, that we say that Christ was born
a hundred and fifty years ago under Quirinius, and taught
what we say he taught still later, under Pontius Pilate, and

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_272"/>  <strong>{Page 272}</strong> should accuse us [as supposing] that all men born before that
time were irresponsible, I will solve this difficulty in advance.
We have been taught that Christ is the First-begotten of God,
and have previously testified that he is the Reason of which
every race of man partakes. Those who lived in accordance
with Reason are Christians, even though they were called godless,
such as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus and others
like them; among the barbarians, Abraham, Ananiah, Azariah,
and Mishael,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p60.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p60.1"><sup class="Note">766</sup></a> and Elijah, and many others, whose deeds and
names I forbear to list, knowing that this would be lengthy.
So also those who lived without Reason were ungracious and
enemies to Christ, and murderers of those who lived by Reason.
But those who lived by Reason, and those who so live now,
are Christians, fearless and unperturbed. For what cause a man
was conceived of a virgin by the power of the Word according
to the will of God, the Father and Master of all, and was named
Jesus, and after being crucified and dying rose again and
ascended into heaven, an intelligent man will be able to comprehend from the words that were spoken in various ways. But
since the further demonstration of this does not seem necessary
at the moment, I will pass on to more needed demonstrations.</p>

47. Hear how the prophetic Spirit said that the land of the
Jews would be ravaged. The words are spoken as in the
character of the people, wondering at what had happened, as
follows: “Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem has become
like a wilderness, the house of our sanctuary [is made] a curse,
and the glory which our fathers praised is burned with fire,
and all its glorious things are fallen. And you abide these things,
and have kept silence, and have humbled us greatly.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p61.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p61.1"><sup class="Note">767</sup></a> You are well aware that Jerusalem was laid waste, as it was predicted
would happen. That it would be laid waste, and no one permitted to dwell there, was said through Isaiah the prophet:
“Their land is a desert, their enemies eat it up before them,
and none of them will dwell in it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p61.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p61.3"><sup class="Note">768</sup></a> You certainly know that
under your guard there is no one in it, and that death has been
decreed against any Jew caught entering.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p61.6" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p61.6"><sup class="Note">769</sup></a></p>

48. How it was prophesied that our Christ would heal all

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_273"/>  <strong>{Page 273}</strong> diseases and raise the dead, hear what was spoken, as follows: “At his coming the lame will leap like a hart, and the stammering tongue will be clear; blind will see and lepers be cleansed, and the dead will arise and walk.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p62.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p62.1"><sup class="Note">770</sup></a> That he did these things, you can learn from the Acts of what took place under Pontius Pilate. How it was testified by the prophetic Spirit that he would be put to death, together with the men who hoped in him, hear what was said through Isaiah, as follows: “See how the just One perishes and no one takes it to heart, and just men are slain and none consider it. The Just One is taken away from the presence of wickedness, and his burial will be in peace; he is taken away from the midst [of us].”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p62.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p62.4"><sup class="Note">771</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p63">49. Here again is how it was said through the same Isaiah, that the peoples of the Gentiles who were not looking for him would worship him, and the Jews who were constantly looking for him would not recognize him when he came. These words
are spoken as in the character of the Christ himself, as follows: “I became manifest to those who asked not after me, I was found by those who sought me not. I said, Here am I, to a nation who did not call upon my name. I stretched out my hands over a disobedient and contradicting people, over those who walked in a way that was not good, but after their sins, a people who rouse me to anger.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p63.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p63.1"><sup class="Note">772</sup></a> For the Jews, having the prophecies, and constantly looking for the Christ, failed to
recognize him when he came—more than that, they even mistreated him. But men of the Gentiles, who had never even heard about Christ until his apostles who came forth from Jerusalem testified to the things about him and gave them the prophecies, were filled with joy and faith, turned away from their idols, and dedicated themselves to the unbegotten God through Christ. That the slanders which would be spoken against those who confess Christ were foreknown, and how those would be afflicted who slander him and say that it is better to keep the ancient customs, hear what was briefly spoken through Isaiah as follows: “Woe to those who call sweet bitter and bitter sweet.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p63.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p63.3"><sup class="Note">773</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p64">50. How, being made man for us, he endured suffering and dishonor, and will come again with glory—hear the prophecies which were spoken to this effect, as follows:</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p65">
“Because they delivered his soul to death, and he was counted with the wicked, he has borne the sins of many, and

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_274"/>  <strong>{Page 274}</strong> will make propitiation for the wicked.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p65.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p65.1"><sup class="Note">774</sup></a> For behold, my
servant will understand and be exalted and greatly glorified.
As many will be astonished at you, so your form will be dishonored from [among] men and your glory from men, so that
many nations will wonder, and kings will shut their mouths;
because those who were not told about him will see, and those
who have not heard will understand. O Lord, who has believed
our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
We have spoken before him as a child, as a root in thirsty
ground. He has no form nor glory; and we saw him and he
had no form nor beauty, but his form was dishonored and
despised beyond [any of] mankind. He was a stricken man,
knowing how to bear infirmity, because his face was turned
away, and he was dishonored and not esteemed. It is he who
bears our sins and undergoes travail for us, and we thought
him to be in distress, smitten and afflicted. But he was wounded
for our wickednesses and suffered infirmity for our sins; the
chastisement of [our] peace was upon him, and by his bruises
we are healed. We have all as sheep gone astray, [every]
man has gone astray in his own way. And he gave himself up
for our sins, and did not open his mouth because of affliction.
He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb before its
shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. In his humiliation
his judgment was taken away.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p65.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p65.3"><sup class="Note">775</sup></a> For after he was crucified
even all his acquaintances deserted him, denying him. But
later, when he rose from the dead and appeared to them, and
taught them to consult the prophecies, in which it was predicted that all these things would happen; and when they had
seen him ascending into heaven, and believed on him, and
received the power which he sent them from there, and went
into every race of men, they taught these things and were
known as apostles.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p66">
51. In order to testify to us that he who suffered these things
is of ineffable origin and reigns over his enemies, the prophetic
Spirit spoke thus:</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p67">
“Who will declare his generation? For his life was taken away
from the earth; on account of their wickednesses he goes to
death. And I will give the wicked for his burial and the rich
for his death, for he did no wickedness nor was guilt found
in his mouth. And the Lord wills to cleanse him from the
blow. If you give an offering for sin, your soul will see a long-lived

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_275"/>  <strong>{Page 275}</strong> seed. And the Lord wills to remove his soul from sorrow,
to show him light and to form him with understanding, to
justify the just One who is a good servant to many. And he
shall bear away our sins. Because of this he will inherit many
and divide the booty of the strong, for that his soul was delivered to death, and he was numbered among the wicked,
and he himself bore the sins of many, and because of their
wickednesses he was betrayed.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p67.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p67.1"><sup class="Note">776</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p68">Hear how he was to go up to heaven, as it was prophesied.
This was spoken: “Lift up the gates of heaven, be opened, that

to come from heaven with glory, hear what was spoken to this
effect through Jeremiah the prophet, as follows: “Behold how
the Son of Man comes on the clouds of heaven, and his angels
with him.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p68.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p68.3"><sup class="Note">778</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p69">
52. Since we have shown that all these things that have
already happened were proclaimed in advance through the
prophets before they happened, it must similarly be believed
that those things which were similarly prophesied and are yet
to happen will certainly take place. Just as these things which
have already happened came true, proclaimed in advance and
[yet] unrecognized, so in the same way the remainder, even if
unacknowledged and disbelieved, will come to pass. For the
prophets foretold two comings of Christ—one, which has
already happened, as that of a dishonored and passible man,
and the second, when as has been foretold he will come from
heaven in glory with his angelic host, when he will raise the
bodies of all the men who have ever lived, and will clothe the
worthy with incorruption, but send those of the wicked, eternally conscious, into eternal fire with the evil demons. How it
was predicted that these things will happen we will show. This
was spoken through the prophet Ezekiel: “Joint will come together with joint and bone with bone, and flesh will grow again. And every knee will bow to the Lord and every tongue will confess him.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p69.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p69.1"><sup class="Note">779</sup></a> That the wicked will be punished, still conscious, hear what was similarly spoken on this topic, as follows: “Their worm shall not rest, and their fire shall not be
extinguished.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p69.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p69.4"><sup class="Note">780</sup></a> And then they will repent, when it will no
longer do them any good. What the peoples of the Jews will

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_276"/>  <strong>{Page 276}</strong> say and do, when they see him coming in glory, was thus prophesied through the prophet Zechariah:</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p70">
“I will command the four winds to bring together the scattered children; I will command the north wind to carry them, and the south wind not to keep them back.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p70.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p70.1"><sup class="Note">781</sup></a> And then there will be great lamentation in Jerusalem, not a lamentation of mouths or lips, but a lamentation of the heart, and they shall rend not their garments but their minds. Tribe after tribe will lament, and then they will see him whom they pierced,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p70.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p70.4"><sup class="Note">782</sup></a> and will say: Why, O Lord, did you make us wander astray from thy way? The glory which our fathers praised has become our disgrace.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p70.7" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p70.7"><sup class="Note">783</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p71">
53. I could cite many other prophecies too, but pause, thinking that these are sufficient to convince those who have ears to hear and understand, and considering that such people can understand that we do not, like those who tell the mythical
stories about the so-called sons of Zeus, merely talk, without having proofs. For why should we believe a crucified man that he is First-begotten of the Unbegotten God, and that he will pass judgment on the whole human race, unless we found testimonies proclaimed about him before he came, and was made man, and see that things have thus happened? For we have seen the desolation of the land of the Jews, and the men of every nation who have been persuaded by the teaching that comes from his apostles, and have turned away from the old customs in which they lived, wandering astray—that is ourselves, since we know that the Gentile Christians are more numerous and truer than those from among the Jews and Samaritans. For all the other nations of mankind are called Gentiles by the prophetic Spirit, while the Jewish and Samaritan tribes are called Israel and House of Jacob. How it was prophesied that more of the Gentiles would be believers than of the Jews and Samaritans—I will cite what was prophesied. It was spoken thus: “Rejoice, O barren and bearing not, break forth and shout, you who did not travail, for the children of
the desolate are more than those of her who had a husband.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p71.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p71.1"><sup class="Note">784</sup></a> For all the Gentiles were desolate of the true God, serving the works of [men’s] hands. But Jews and Samaritans, having the word from God given them through the prophets and constantly looking for the Christ, did not recognize him when he came,
except only for a few, whose salvation the holy prophetic

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_277"/>  <strong>{Page 277}</strong> Spirit predicted through Isaiah. For he said, speaking as in their character, “Except the Lord had left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and Gomorrha.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p71.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p71.3"><sup class="Note">785</sup></a> Moses tells the story of Sodom and Gomorrha, cities of godless men which God
overthrew, burning them with fire and brimstone, none of the people in them being saved except a certain stranger of Chaldaean race, Lot by name, with whom his daughters were saved also. Those who want to can see their whole countryside,
desolate and burned and still unproductive. That it was foreknown that those of the Gentiles would be truer and more faithful, we will cite what was said through Isaiah the prophet. He spoke thus, “Israel is uncircumcised in heart, and the Gentiles
are the uncircumcision,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p71.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p71.5"><sup class="Note">786</sup></a> seeing such things should reasonably bring conviction and faith to those who welcome the truth, and are not vainglorious or controlled by their passions.</p>

54. But those who hand on the myths invented by the poets offer no demonstration to the youngsters who learn them—indeed I [am prepared to] show that they were told at the instigation of the wicked demons to deceive and lead astray the human race. For when they heard it predicted through the prophets that Christ was to come, and that impious men would be punished by fire, they put forward a number of so-called sons of Zeus, thinking that they could thus make men suppose that what was said about Christ was a mere tale of wonders like the stories told by the poets. These stories were spread among the Greeks and all the Gentiles, where, as they heard the prophets proclaiming, Christ would especially be believed in. But, as I will make clear, though they heard the words of the prophets they did not understand them accurately, but made mistakes in imitating what was told about our Christ. The prophet Moses was, as I said before, older than all [Greek] writers, and this prophecy was made through him, as previously cited: “The ruler shall not depart from Judah, nor the governor from his thighs, until he come for whom it is reserved; and he
shall be the expectation of the nations, binding his colt to the

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_278"/>  <strong>{Page 278}</strong> vine, washing his robe in the blood of the grape.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p72.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p72.1"><sup class="Note">787</sup></a> So when
the demons heard these prophetic words they made out that
Dionysus had been a son of Zeus, and handed down that he
was the discoverer of the vine (hence they introduce wine in his
mysteries), and taught that after being torn in pieces he ascended
into heaven. Now the prophecy given through Moses did not
precisely indicate whether he who was to come would be the
Son of God, and whether, mounted on a colt, he would remain
on earth or ascend into heaven; and the word “colt” can indicate the colt of an ass or a horse. So not knowing whether the
predicted one would bring the colt of an ass or of a horse as the
symbol of his coming, and, as said above, whether he was the
Son of God or of a man, they said that Bellerophon, a man
and born of men, had gone up to heaven on the horse Pegasus.
Then when they heard it said through that other prophet
Isaiah that he was to be born of a virgin and would ascend into
heaven by his own [power], they put forward what is told about
Perseus. When they learned that it was said, as has been quoted,
in the ancient prophecies, “Strong as a giant to run his
course,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p72.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p72.3"><sup class="Note">788</sup></a> they said that Heracles was strong and had traveled
over the whole earth. Again when they learned that it was
prophesied that he would heal every disease and raise the dead,
they brought forward Asclepius.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p72.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p72.5"><sup class="Note">789</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p73">
55. But never was the crucifixion imitated in the case of any of the so-called sons of Zeus; for they did not understand it since, as has been explained, everything said about it was expressed symbolically. Yet, as the prophet predicted, it [the cross] is the greatest symbol of his power and authority, as [can be] shown from things you can see. Reflect on all things in the universe [and consider] whether they could be governed or held together in fellowship without this figure. For the sea cannot be traversed unless the sign of victory, which is called a sail,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p73.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p73.1"><sup class="Note">790</sup></a> remain fast in the ship; the land is not plowed without it; similarly diggers and mechanics do not do their work except with tools of this form. The human figure differs from the irrational animals precisely in this, that man stands erect and
can stretch out his hands, and has on his face, stretched down from the forehead, what is called the nose, through which goes breath for the living creature—and this exhibits precisely the

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_279"/>  <strong>{Page 279}</strong> figure of the cross. So it was said through the prophet, “The
breath before our face is Christ the Lord.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p73.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p73.2"><sup class="Note">791</sup></a> Even your own
symbols display the power of this figure—on the standards
and trophies, with which you make all your solemn processions, using these [cross-shaped objects] as signs of authority, even though without understanding what you’re doing.
Then you set up the images of your deceased emperors on this
figure, and in the inscriptions call them gods. So now since
I have done my best to persuade you, both by argument and
by [appealing to] a visible figure, I am free from reproach even
if you disbelieve; my part is done and finished.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p74">56. The wicked demons were not satisfied with saying before
the appearance of Christ that there had been the so-called
sons of Zeus. After he had appeared and lived among men,
when they learned how he had been predicted by the prophets,
and saw how he was believed on and looked for in every race,
they again, as we showed before, put forward others, Simon
and Menander of Samaria, who by doing mighty works of
magic deceived and are still deceiving many. For as I said
before, Simon lived in your own imperial city of Rome under
Claudius Caesar, and so impressed the Sacred Senate and the
Roman people that he was thought to be a god and was
honored with a statue like the other gods whom you honor.
We ask you therefore to join the Sacred Senate and your people
as joint judges of this petition of ours, so that if any are ensnared
by his teachings they may be able to learn the truth and flee
from this error. And, if you will, destroy the statue.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p75">57. Nor can the wicked demons persuade men that there
will be no burning for the punishment of the impious, just as
they were not able to keep Christ hidden when he came. All
they can do is to make men who live contrary to reason, having
been brought up in bad habits of passion and prejudice, kill
and hate us. Yet we do not hate them, but, as is evident, pity
them and try to persuade them to reform. For we are not afraid
of death, admitting that we are certainly going to die, and
[since] there is nothing new [for unbelievers], but things continue the same in this dispensation—if boredom seizes those
who share in such things even for a year,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p75.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p75.1"><sup class="Note">792</sup></a> then in order to be

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_280"/>  <strong>{Page 280}</strong> free from suffering and want they should pay attention to our
teachings. If they do not believe that there is anything after
death, but declare that those who die pass into unconsciousness,
then they are our benefactors in delivering us from the sufferings
and needs [of life] here. But they still show themselves to be
wicked, misanthropic, and prejudiced. For they do not kill us
in order to set us free, but rather murder us in order to deprive
us of life and its pleasures.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p76">58. As I said before, the wicked demons have also put forward Marcion of Pontus, who is even now teaching men to
deny that God is the Maker of all things in heaven and earth
and that the Christ predicted by the prophets is his Son. He
preaches another God besides the Fashioner of the universe,
and likewise another Son. Many are persuaded by him, as if
he alone knew the truth, and make fun of us, though they have
no proof of the things they say, but are irrationally snatched
away, like lambs by a wolf,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p76.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p76.1"><sup class="Note">793</sup></a> and become the prey of
godless teachings and of demons. For those who are called
demons strive for nothing else than to draw men away
from God who made [them] and from Christ his First-begotten. Those who cannot rise above the earth they have
nailed down by [the worship of] earthly things and the works
of men’s hands. They even push back those who aim at the
contemplation of things divine, unless their thinking is prudent
and pure and their life free from passion, and drive them into
ungodliness.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p77">59. So that you may learn that Plato borrowed from our
teachers, I mean from the Word [speaking] through the prophets, when he said that God made the universe by changing
formless matter, hear the precise words of Moses, who as declared above was the first of the prophets and older than the
Greek writers. The prophetic Spirit testified through him how
in the beginning God fashioned the universe, and out of what,
saying: “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was invisible and unfurnished, and darkness
[was] over the abyss; and the Spirit of God was borne over
the waters. And God said, Let there be light. And it
was so.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p77.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p77.1"><sup class="Note">794</sup></a> So by God’s word the whole universe was
made out of this substratum, as expounded by Moses, and
Plato and those who agree with him, as well as we, have
learned it [from him], and you can be sure of it too. We also

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_281"/>  <strong>{Page 281}</strong> know that Moses had already spoken of what the poets call
Erebus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p77.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p77.3"><sup class="Note">795</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p78">60. In the discussion of the nature of the Son of God in
Plato’s
<i>Timaeus</i>,
when he says, “He placed him like an X in
the universe,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p78.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p78.1"><sup class="Note">796</sup></a> this was similarly borrowed from Moses. For
it is recorded in the writings of Moses that in his time, when the
Israelites had gone out of Egypt and were in the wilderness,
they encountered poisonous beasts, vipers and asps, and every
kind of snake which were killing the people. By an inspiration
and influence that came from God, Moses took brass and made
the form of a cross, and placed it over the holy tent, saying
to the people, “If you look on this form and believe on it, you
will be saved.” And he records that when this was done, the
snakes died, and so, he tells us, the people escaped death.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p78.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p78.2"><sup class="Note">797</sup></a> Plato, reading this and not clearly understanding, nor realizing
that it was the form of a cross, but thinking it was [the letter]
Chi, said that the Power next to the first God was placed X-wise
in the universe. And he spoke of a third, since he read what I
have quoted from Moses, that the Spirit of God was borne over
the waters. For he gives the second place to the Word who is
with God, who, he says, was placed X-wise in the universe,
and the third to the Spirit which was said to be borne over the
water, saying, “The third [order of] beings around the third.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p78.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p78.5"><sup class="Note">798</sup></a> And hear how the prophetic Spirit has testified through Moses
that there will be a destruction by fire. He said, “Everliving fire
will descend and will devour even to the abyss below.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p78.6" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p78.6"><sup class="Note">799</sup></a> it is not that we hold the same opinions as others, but that
what all others say is an imitation of ours. Among us you can
hear and learn these things from those who do not even know
the letters of the alphabet—uneducated and barbarous in
speech, but wise and faithful in mind—even from cripples
and the blind. So you can see that these things are not the
product of human wisdom, but are spoken by the power of
God.</p>

      <h4 id="x.ii.iii-p78.8">Christian Worship</h4>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p79">61. How we dedicated ourselves to God when we were made new through Christ I will explain, since it might seem to be unfair if I left this out from my exposition. Those who are persuaded and believe that the things we teach and say are true, and promise that they can live accordingly, are instructed to pray and beseech God with fasting for the remission of their past sins, while we pray and fast along with them. Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are reborn by the same manner of rebirth by which we ourselves were reborn; for they are then washed in the water in the name of God the Father and Master of all, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit. For Christ said, “Unless you are born again you will not enter into the Kingdom of heaven.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p79.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p79.1"><sup class="Note">800</sup></a> Now it is clear to all that those who have once come into being cannot enter the wombs of those who bore them. But as I quoted before, it was said through the prophet Isaiah how those who have sinned and repent shall escape from their sins. He said this: “Wash yourselves, be clean, take away wickednesses from your souls, learn to do good, give judgment for the orphan and defend the cause of the widow, and come and let us reason together, says the Lord. And though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them as white as wool, and though they be as crimson, I will make them as white as snow. If you will not listen to me, the sword will devour you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p79.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p79.3"><sup class="Note">801</sup></a> And we learned from the apostles this reason for this [rite]. At our first birth we were
born of necessity without our knowledge, from moist seed, by the intercourse of our parents with each other, and grew up in bad habits and wicked behavior. So that we should not remain children of necessity and ignorance, but [become sons] of free
choice and knowledge, and obtain remission of the sins we have already committed,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p79.5" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p79.5"><sup class="Note">802</sup></a> there is named at the water, over him who has chosen to be born again and has repented of his sinful acts, the name of God the Father and Master of all.

The illuminand is also washed in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of the Holy Spirit, who through the prophets foretold everything about Jesus.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p80">62. When the demons heard this washing proclaimed through the prophets, they arranged that those who go into their temples and are about to approach them to offer libations and burnt offerings should sprinkle themselves—and further they have them wash themselves completely as they pass on into the sanctuaries where they are enshrined. The order given by the priests to devotees to remove their shoes as they enter the temples and approach them<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p80.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p80.1"><sup class="Note">805</sup></a> [the demons] is an imitation devised by the demons when they learned what happened to Moses, the above-mentioned prophet. For at the time when Moses was ordered to go down to Egypt and bring out the people of the Israelites who were there, as he was pasturing in the land of Arabia the sheep of his maternal uncle, our Christ addressed him in the form of fire out of a bush, and said, “Unloose your sandals and come near and hear.” When he had taken them and approached, he heard [that he was] to go down into Egypt, and lead out the people of the Israelites
there, and received great power from Christ, who spoke to him in the form of fire.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p80.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p80.2"><sup class="Note">806</sup></a> He went down and led out the people after he had done great miracles—if you want to learn about them, you may learn in detail from his writings.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p81">63. Even now the Jews all teach that the unnamed God himself spoke to Moses. Wherefore the prophetic Spirit said in condemnation of them through Isaiah the above-mentioned prophet, as was quoted before: “The ox knows his owner and

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_284"/>  <strong>{Page 284}</strong> the ass his master’s crib, but Israel does not know me and my
people does not understand.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.1"><sup class="Note">807</sup></a> Likewise Jesus the Christ, because the Jews did not know what the Father is and what the Son, himself said in condemnation of them: “No one knows the Father except the Son, nor the Son except the Father and those to whom the Son will reveal it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.3"><sup class="Note">808</sup></a> Now the Word of God is his Son, as I said before. He is also called “Angel” and “Apostle,” for [as Angel] he announces what it is necessary to know, and [as Apostle] is sent forth to testify to what is
announced,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.8" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.8"><sup class="Note">809</sup></a> as our Lord himself said, “He that hears me hears him that sent me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.11" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.11"><sup class="Note">810</sup></a> This can be made clear from the writings of Moses, in which this is to be found: “And the Angel of God spoke to Moses in a flame of fire out of the bush and said, I am he who is, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, the God of your fathers; go down to Egypt and bring out my people.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.15" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.15"><sup class="Note">811</sup></a> Those who wish to can learn what followed from this; for it is not possible to put down everything in these [pages]. But these words were uttered to demonstrate that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Apostle, who was first the Word, and appeared, now in the form of fire, now in the image of the bodiless creatures. Now, however, having become man by the will of God for the sake of the human race, he has endured whatever sufferings the demons managed to have brought upon him by the senseless Jews. For they have it
clearly said in the writings of Moses, “And the Angel of God
spoke to Moses in a flame of fire in the bush and said, I am
he who is, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.17" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.17"><sup class="Note">812</sup></a> yet they say that he who said these things was the Father and Fashioner of the universe. Jesus again, as we cited, when he was with them said, “No one knows the Father except the Son, nor the Son except the Father and those to whom the Son may reveal it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.19" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.19"><sup class="Note">813</sup></a> So the Jews, continuing to think that the Father of the universe had spoken to Moses, when it was the Son of God, who is called both Angel and Apostle, who spoke to him, were rightly censured both by
the prophetic Spirit and by Christ himself, since they knew neither the Father nor the Son. For those who identify the Son and the Father are condemned, as neither knowing the Father nor recognizing that the Father of the universe has a Son,

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_285"/>  <strong>{Page 285}</strong> who being the Word and First-begotten of God is also divine.
Formerly he appeared in the form of fire and the image of a
bodiless being to Moses and the other prophets. But now in
the time of your dominion he was, as I have said, made man
of a virgin according to the will of the Father for the salvation of those who believe in him, and endured contempt and suffering so that by dying and rising again he might conquer death. What was said out of the bush to Moses, “I am he who is, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob and the God of your fathers,” was an indication that they though dead still existed and were Christ’s own men. For they were the first of all men to devote themselves to seeking after God,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p81.24" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p81.24"><sup class="Note">814</sup></a> Abraham being the father of Isaac, and Isaac of Jacob, as Moses also recorded.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p82">64. From what has been said you can understand why the
demons contrived to have the image of the so-called Kore
erected at the springs of waters, saying that she was a daughter
of Zeus, imitating what was said through Moses. For Moses
said, as I have quoted: “In the beginning God made the heaven
and the earth. And the earth was invisible and unfurnished,
and the Spirit of God was borne over the waters.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p82.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p82.1"><sup class="Note">815</sup></a> In imitation of the Spirit of God, spoken of as borne over the water, they spoke of Kore, daughter of Zeus. With similar malice they
spoke of Athena as a daughter of Zeus, but not as a result of
intercourse—since they knew that God designed the creation
of the world by the Word, they spoke of Athena as the first
Concept. This we consider very ridiculous, to offer the female
form as the image of an intellectual concept. And similarly the
other so-called sons of Zeus are condemned by their actions.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p83">65. We, however, after thus washing the one who has been
convinced and signified his assent, lead him to those who are
called brethren, where they are assembled. They then earnestly
offer common prayers for themselves and the one who has been
illuminated and all others everywhere, that we may be made
worthy, having learned the truth, to be found in deed good
citizens and keepers of what is commanded, so that we may
be saved with eternal salvation. On finishing the prayers we


<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_286"/>  <strong>{Page 286}</strong> greet each other with a kiss. Then bread and a cup of water
and mixed wine are brought to the president of the brethren
and he, taking them, sends up praise and glory to the Father
of the universe through the name of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, and offers thanksgiving at some length that we have been
deemed worthy to receive these things from him. When he
has finished the prayers and the thanksgiving,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p83.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p83.1"><sup class="Note">816</sup></a> the whole congregation present<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p83.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p83.2"><sup class="Note">817</sup></a> assents, saying, “Amen.” “Amen” in the Hebrew language means, “So be it.” When the president has given thanks and the whole congregation has assented, those whom we call deacons give to each of those present a portion of the consecrated<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p83.4" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p83.4"><sup class="Note">818</sup></a> bread and wine and water, and they take it to the absent.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p84">66. This food we call Eucharist, of which no one is allowed
to partake except one who believes that the things we teach are
true, and has received the washing for forgiveness of sins and
for rebirth, and who lives as Christ handed down to us. For we
do not receive these things as common bread or common
drink; but as Jesus Christ our Saviour being incarnate by God’s
word took flesh and blood for our salvation, so also we have
been taught that the food consecrated by the word of prayer
which comes from him, from which our flesh and blood are
nourished by transformation, is the flesh and blood of that
incarnate Jesus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p84.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p84.1"><sup class="Note">819</sup></a> For the apostles in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, thus handed down what was commanded them: that Jesus, taking bread and having given thanks, said, “Do this for my memorial, this is my body”; and likewise taking the cup and giving thanks he said, “This is my blood”; and gave it to them alone.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p84.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p84.3"><sup class="Note">820</sup></a> This also the wicked

<span class="pb" id="x.ii.iii-Page_287"/>  <strong>{Page 287}</strong> demons in imitation handed down as something to be done in
the mysteries of Mithra; for bread and a cup of water are
brought out in their secret rites of initiation, with certain
invocations which you either know or can learn.</p>
      <p id="x.ii.iii-p85">67. After these [services] we constantly remind each other
of these things. Those who have more come to the aid of those
who lack, and we are constantly together. Over all that we
receive we bless the Maker of all things through his Son Jesus
Christ and through the Holy Spirit.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p85.1" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p85.1"><sup class="Note">821</sup></a> And on the day called
Sunday there is a meeting in one place of those who live in
cities or the country, and the memoirs of the apostles or the
writings of the prophets are read as long as time permits. When
the reader has finished, the president in a discourse urges
and invites [us] to the imitation of these noble things. Then we
all stand up together and offer prayers. And, as said before,
when we have finished the prayer, bread is brought, and wine
and water, and the president similarly sends up prayers and
thanksgivings to the best of his ability, and the congregation
assents, saying the Amen; the distribution, and reception of the
consecrated [elements] by each one, takes place and they are
sent to the absent by the deacons. Those who prosper, and who
so wish, contribute, each one as much as he chooses to.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p85.2" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p85.2"><sup class="Note">822</sup></a> What
is collected is deposited with the president, and he takes care
of orphans and widows, and those who are in want on account
of sickness or any other cause, and those who are in bonds, and
the strangers who are sojourners among [us], and, briefly, he
is the protector of all those in need. We all hold this common
gathering on Sunday, since it is the first day, on which God
transforming darkness and matter made the universe, and
Jesus Christ our Saviour rose from the dead on the same day.
For they crucified him on the day before Saturday, and on
the day after Saturday,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.ii.iii-p85.3" href="#fnf_x.ii.iii-p85.3"><sup class="Note">823</sup></a> he appeared to his apostles and

with respect—if it seems foolish to you, then despise us as

will not escape the future judgment of God if you continue
unjust, while we will cry out, What God desires, let that be

illustrious Caesar Hadrian, we could demand that you order
judgment to be given as we have asked. Yet we do not ask [for

what we ask is just, we have made this petition and explanation.
I have subjoined a copy of the letter of Hadrian, so that you
may know that I speak the truth in this matter. Here is the

people of your province can formally support their petition
against the Christians by accusing them of something before
[your] tribunal, I do not forbid their following this course;
but I do not permit them to make use of mere requests and
clamorous demands in this matter. It is much more proper, if
anyone wishes to bring an accusation, for you to take cognizance of the matters brought forward. Therefore if anyone
brings an accusation and proves that the men referred to have

        <i>A Plea Regarding Christians by Athenagoras, the Philosopher</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="x.iii.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p1"><span class="sc">It is an odd fact that the author of what in</span>
many ways is the ablest of the Greek Apologies remained
almost unknown in Christian antiquity. Apart from a
citation in a third century writer, Methodius of Tyre,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p1.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p1.2"><sup class="Note">828</sup></a> and a misleading reference in a most unreliable historian of the fifth
century, Philip of Side, Athenagoras’ work is passed over in
silence by the Church Fathers. Philip’s
<i>Christian History</i> is lost,
but fragments have been preserved by the fourteenth century
compiler Nicephorus Callistus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p1.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p1.3"><sup class="Note">829</sup></a> Athenagoras is there stated
to have been the first head of the catechetical school of Alexandria, to have had Clement as his pupil, to have flourished
in the time of Hadrian and Antoninus, and, while bent on
attacking Christianity, to have been converted through studying Scripture. No weight can be given to any of these statements: the first three are without question wrong. Again, it is
vaguely possible (one can hardly say more) that our Athenagoras is the one to whom the second century philosopher Boethos addressed his work,
<i>On Obscure Expressions in Plato.</i><a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p1.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p1.4"><sup class="Note">830</sup></a> In any case, neither Eusebius nor Jerome mentions him, and
we are left to deduce what we can about him from his writings.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p2">Of these but two have survived: his Plea Regarding Christians and his Treatise on the Resurrection. From their titles we

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.i-Page_291"/>  <strong>{Page 291}</strong> gather that Athenagoras was a Christian philosopher of Athens.
We owe these titles, it is true, to a tenth century manuscript,
the Aretas Codex, and they may not be reliable. Yet the
moderation of Athenagoras’ Plea, its clarity and sense of order
along with its suggestions of Attic style, give them a certain
credence.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.i-p2.1">Date</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p3">The date of the Plea can be determined with reasonable
certainty. It is addressed to the emperors Marcus Aurelius and
Lucius Aurelius Commodus. The latter is doubtless Marcus
Aurelius’ son, who was raised to the purple in <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p3.1"/>A.D.</span> 176. Later on in the Plea, Athenagoras refers directly to the relationship
of father and son which existed between the two emperors
(chs. 18 and 37). Another indication of date is the mention of
the profound peace which the Empire is enjoying (ch. 1).
The only period between <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p3.2"/>A.D.</span> 176 and the date of Marcus Aurelius’
death in <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p3.3"/>A.D.</span> 180 that would adequately fit this reference is
176–177. These dates mark the suppression of the insurrection
of Avidus Crassus on the one hand, and the outbreak of the
Marcomannic War on the other. Since, too, Athenagoras makes
no mention of the violent, though local, outbreak of persecution
in Lyons and Vienne,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p3.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p3.4"><sup class="Note">831</sup></a> which occurred in the latter part of <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p3.5"/>A.D.</span> 177, we may safely assume that the Plea was written between the end of <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p3.6"/>A.D.</span> 176 and the early part of
<span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p3.7"/>A.D.</span> 177.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p4">To these calculations two objections have been raised. It
has been questioned whether Marcus Aurelius’ son is intended
by the name Lucius Aurelius Commodus, and it has been
suggested that the Plea betrays a faint reflection of the persecution of Lyons and Vienne.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p5">To appreciate the discussion of the first objection, the exact
words of Athenagoras’ inscription must be borne in mind. He
writes, “To the Emperors Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and
Lucius Aurelius Commodus, conquerors of Armenia and Sarmatia, and—what is more important—philosophers.” Who is
Lucius Aurelius Commodus? The title “conqueror of Armenia”
properly belongs to Marcus Aurelius’ adopted brother, Lucius
Aurelius Verus Commodus, not to his son. But the adopted
brother can scarcely be meant. He dropped the name Commodus on sharing the government with Marcus Aurelius, and
he never bore the title “conqueror of Sarmatia,” since this
conquest occurred only after his death in <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="x.iii.i-p5.1"/>A.D.</span> 169. The fact

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.i-Page_292"/>  <strong>{Page 292}</strong> of the matter seems to be that Athengoras associates the son
with the father in his honors. This is clear from the fact that
both are styled “philosophers.” Neither the son nor the
adopted brother, for that matter, could have any personal
claim to such a title.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p6">The second objection is equally tenuous. It has been urged<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p6.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p6.1"><sup class="Note">832</sup></a> that, because the same charges of cannibalism and incest are
mentioned by Athenagoras and by the letter of the churches

of Lyons and Vienne, recording their persecution,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p6.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p6.2"><sup class="Note">833</sup></a> and because one other slight similarity can be detected,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p6.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p6.3"><sup class="Note">834</sup></a> Athenagoras
reflects a knowledge of this letter. In reply it must be observed
that such charges were too widespread to indicate Athenagoras’
dependence upon that particular document, while the other
supposed similarity is too meager to be taken into account.
Moreover, had Athenagoras had that letter in mind, he would
scarcely have claimed (in ch. 35) that slaves of Christians had
never denounced their masters for cannibalism. For at Lyons
and Vienne it was slaves who had preferred this very accusation.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p6.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p6.4"><sup class="Note">835</sup></a> It may be noted too that the charge of atheism, which
forms the main burden of the Plea, does not happen to be
mentioned in the letter.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.i-p6.5">Style</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p7">Of all the Apologists, Athenagoras is the most eloquent. The
arrangement of his material is clear and his argument moves
with cogency. His rhythmic style, patterned after that of the
Atticists, betrays the self-conscious rhetorician. He has some
notable descriptions, and his detailed references to mythology
and history, which at times seem irrelevant to his central point,
are quite purposeful. They aim to hold the reader’s attention
by providing interesting information. On the other hand, his
style suffers from ellipses, parentheses (of which there are
many), and anacolutha. This is partly to be explained by his
intention to give his Apology the air of a speech which was
actually delivered. This fiction underlies the reference in ch. 11

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.i-Page_293"/>  <strong>{Page 293}</strong> (see note 35). Athenagoras did not, of course, give his Apology
as a public oration in the emperor’s presence.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.i-p7.1">Contents and Purpose</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p8">The Plea answers three current charges brought against
Christianity—atheism, incest, and cannibalism. It is the first
of these with which the large body of the work is concerned
(chs. 3 to 30). The others are treated rather summarily at the
end (chs. 31 to 36). The case against atheism is the central point,
for, with this proved, the moral calumnies are in principle
disposed of. This division of material, moreover, reflects the
rhetorical skill of Athenagoras. He realized that the attention
of his audience would be better held by expanding the first
point, while correspondingly contracting the second and third.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p9">
The charges themselves were a natural result of the Christian
message. To deny the traditional gods, to stand in opposition
to the syncretic temper of the age, and above all to claim to
practice a religion which dispensed with the most essential
mark of ancient religion, viz., sacrifice, could not but have
provoked the accusation of atheism. Furthermore, the close
association, in the ancient mind, of gods with race and soil must
have made it extremely hard for the pagan to take the Christian
case seriously. The Christians were not a racial or national
group venerating the traditions of their forefathers. The new
religion seemed to be undermining every religious sanction of
antiquity.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p10">
The charges of incest and cannibalism arose from the fact
that only the baptized were permitted to attend the Eucharist.
What, therefore, was done in secret by such people was quite
likely, in the pagan’s mind, to be immoral. Moreover, the fragmentary knowledge which the pagan gained by hearsay about
the meaning of the Lord’s Supper—eating and drinking the
body and blood of Christ—quickly led to the suspicion of cannibalism; while the Christian emphasis on love and brotherhood
was easily distorted into a cloak for incest.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p11">
Athenagoras’ aim in the Plea is to show that Christianity is
a respectable philosophy, distinguished by a peculiarly high
standard of moral conduct. He urges that Christians should
be given the same fair treatment accorded other philosophers (ch. 2, <i>fin</i>.). They should not be persecuted because of a name.
Rather should each be tried on his own merits, and only punished if a real offense is proved. The emphasis laid by Christian

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.i-Page_294"/>  <strong>{Page 294}</strong> Apologists on their being persecuted because of a name is not
so foolish as is sometimes imagined. The name was primary:
It had become a symbol of social opprobium, and around it
there had gathered a host of wild and unsubstantiated charges.
It is true, of course, that what basically underlay the opposition
to the name was the Christian refusal to sacrifice to the pagan
gods, and notably to the imperial genius. But the Apologists
felt that it was the absurd rumors and emotionalism which the
name engendered, that prevented their case from being heard
with reason. Hence their emphasis on the irrationality of opposing a mere name.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p12">On the question of the imperial cult Athenagoras is shrewdly
silent. He has many protestations of loyalty to the emperor,
and perhaps hints at his view of the imperial genius in his
reference to Antinous (ch. 30) and to the gods’ having originally
been kings (ch. 28). But he naturally refrains from making a
clear issue of this point, lest he should endanger the strength of
his apology. His intention is to gain a hearing for the Christian
case for monotheism. Only then could the current manner of
showing loyalty to the Empire be successfully challenged.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p13">To answer the charge of atheism Athenagoras shows that the
Christians share their conviction of the unity of God with the
great Greek philosophers and poets. Here was the point at
which Christianity could relate itself to the finest spirit of antiquity, and so win a hearing. Proceeding from this, Athenagoras
demonstrates the unique elements in the new faith, viz., the
doctrine of the Trinity and the high moral life of the Christians;
and he continues by showing the weaknesses in the traditional
religion with its sacrifices and mythology.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.i-p13.1">Philosophy and Theology</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p14">Neither as a philosopher nor as a theologian did Athenagoras
possess a creative mind. Nor can he be said to be a profound
scholar. He was a Christian rhetorician, combining a graceful
style with some originality and considerable knowledge.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p15">He was well acquainted with the leading ideas of the current
philosophies and his outlook betrays the essential spirit of the
age—eclecticism. Doubtless he had read Homer, Plato, and
Herodotus. But the majority of his many citations come (as
he himself confesses) from florilegia (see chs. 6 and 33). This
was a current practice of rhetoricians. In some cases, where
the context was not clear, it could not fail to lead to misconstruction

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.i-Page_295"/>  <strong>{Page 295}</strong> of the original. Notable examples are the first two
citations from Euripides in ch. 5. A good deal of ch. 28, along
with other notices of pagan theology, is taken from a work
by Apollodorus, <i>On the Gods.</i> The list of gods in ch. 1 may go
back to the same book, though Athenagoras may here have
obtained his information secondhand through some skeptical
writer who used the references in Apollodorus for polemical
purposes. Athenagoras may also be dependent on Plutarch’s
<i>Placita</i> for some of his material. There are a number of similarities, but no exact citations.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p15.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p15.1"><sup class="Note">836</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p16">Athenagoras shows his originality in several ways. His
rational argument for the unity of God (ch. 8) has no parallel
in ancient literature, and the references sometimes cited from
Cicero and Philo<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.i-p16.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.i-p16.1"><sup class="Note">837</sup></a> serve only to indicate his independent
mind. Again, while he is dependent upon Justin’s Apology for
many of his ideas, his line of approach is rather different.
He does not elaborate the argument from Old Testament
prophecy with the endless details and citations we find in Justin.
Such references, which consume about a third of Justin’s work,
were scarcely calculated to convince pagans. Nor does he
indulge in Justin’s fanciful ideas of Plato’s prediction of the
cross or of his dependence on Moses. His references to the Old
Testament are few, and he has better sensed the temper of his
readers by dealing more thoroughly with the current religious
notions and their essential weaknesses.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p17">Philosophically Athenagoras is an eclectic. From Plato he
derives his ideas of God’s essential goodness (ch. 24) and of the
primacy of the immaterial (ch. 36). From the Stoics he takes
his emphasis on the harmony and order of the world as a proof
of God (chs. 4; 5; 16); his contrast of man’s unnatural vice
with the natural life of beasts (ch, 3); and his psychological
explanation of visions (ch. 27). From the Neo-Pythagoreans
comes his view of the cosmos as an enclosed sphere moving in
rhythm (ch. 16). He is dependent on the Skeptics for his
account of the prolific number and contradictory nature of the
cults (chs. 1; 14), and for his conviction that the many conflicting doctrines of philosophy indicate that reason has its
limits (ch. 7). In this hospitable attitude toward Greek philosophy and culture Athenagoras shares Justin’s view, which
stands in marked contrast with that of his Syrian contemporary, Tatian.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.iii.i-Page_296"/>  <strong>{Page 296}</strong> 
      <p id="x.iii.i-p18">Athenagoras owes his theological ideas largely to Justin.
&amp;gt;From him come the Logos doctrine, his views of prophetic
inspiration, resurrection, demonology, angelology, and so on.
Unique with Athenagoras, however, is his clear exposition of
the Trinity (ch. 10), his careful avoidance of subordinating
the Son, his emphasis on chastity, and his condemnation of
second marriages (ch. 33). Regarding this latter, it has been
contended that Athenagoras here shows the influence of
Montanism. But it must be noted that Athenagoras’ moral
attitudes are not so severe as those of the Montanists, and that
an increasing veneration of asceticism was characteristic of the second century.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.i-p19">Apart from a vague and passing reference in ch. 21,
Athenagoras makes no mention of the incarnation. This may seem
strange to us, for whom this doctrine is central. But we must
remember that Athenagoras’ purpose is apologetic. He is not
writing a systematic theology, but defending the faith against
certain calumnies. Hence Athenagoras’ Christianity cannot
be completely reconstructed from his Apology. It is a mistake
to imagine that, because the fullness of the faith is not apparent
in their works, the Apologists attenuated Christianity by
accommodating it to Greek culture. Their first aim was the
same as that of the modern missionary—to defend monotheism.
That was the prerequisite to establishing the truth of Christianity, and the basis upon which the gospel rested. Hence the Apologists narrowed their sights to concentrate
on this fundamental issue, and they leaned on Greek philosophy to make a
contact with their readers. If one compares Tertullian’s apologetic works with those addressed specifically to Christians, one
notes the same approach. The apologetic treatises do not give
a whole account of Christianity. Thus, in reading Athenagoras,
one must not seek for a full exposition of the faith, or imagine
that this one tract contains all that he believed. In short,
Athenagoras’ Plea should be read for what it claims to be—a
defense of practical monotheism. By setting Christianity almost
exclusively in this light, the author proved himself a somewhat
more astute Apologist than Justin. He sought to show that the
new faith corresponded to the best philosophic schools of the day.</p>

Apologies, is far from satisfactorily preserved. All the manuscripts, of which there are many, go directly or indirectly back to the famous Aretas Codex (Paris. Graec. 451<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.ii-p1.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.ii-p1.1"><sup class="Note">838</sup></a>).

The archbishop himself corrected the Codex as carefully as possible, adding the accents and breathings, and separating the words that were undistinguished in the original uncial copied by Baanes.

Apologeten </i>(Aristides and Athenagoras), Leipzig, 1907; E. Goodspeed in his <i>Die ältesten Apologeten, </i>Göttingen, 1914; and P. Ubaldi, <i>Athenagoras, La Supplica Per I Christiani, Testo Critico e Commento, </i>Turin, 1920, second edition, 1933. This was the basis for the edition published by Michele Pellegrino in the Greek series of the Corona Patrum Salesiana, Vol. XV, 1947.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.ii-p5">For the translation offered here, Goodspeed’s text has been
followed. I have not, however, felt obliged to accept all his
emendations. At times I have relied on other texts as well as
on suggestions in modern translations.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.ii-p6">The Plea has been rendered into English by B. P. Pratten in
the Ante-Nicene Christian Library, Vol. II, pp. 123–148,
Buffalo, 1885. The first English translation was by D.
Humphreys, London, 1714. In German there is a translation
by P. A. Eberhard in <i>Frühchristliche Apologeten, </i>in the second series of the Bibliothek der Kirchenväter, Vol. XII, Kempten
and Munich, 1913 (with introduction and useful notes). Most
recent is the French rendering by Gustave Bardy, <i>Athénagore,
supplique au sujet des Chrétiens, </i>Editions du Cerf, Paris, 1943, in the series Sources chrétiennes. This has excellent introductory
material and comprehensive notes. In Italian there is the
edition by Michele Pellegrino already mentioned.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.ii-p7">Invaluable material for the study of Athenagoras will be
found in Johannes Geffcken’s edition. While far from sympathetic, it is rich and often incisive in its handling of parallel
literature, both pagan and Christian. The article “Athenagoras,”
by Spenser Mansel in the <i>Dictionary of Christian Biography,</i> Vol. I., pp. 204–207, London, 1877, should be consulted, as also the
study by G. Bareille in the <i>Dictionnaire de la théologie catholique,</i> Vol. I, cols. 2210–2214, Paris, 1903, and especially the one by P. Keseling in the <i>Reallexikon für Antike and Christentum, </i>Hiersemann Verlag, Leipzig, 1943, cols. 881–888. An earlier but fundamental work is that by L. Arnould, <i>De Apologia Athenagorae, </i>Paris, 1898; while Aim Puech has devoted a lucid chapter to Athenagoras in his <i>Les Apologistes grecs, </i>Paris, 1912. An introductory summary of the general field will be found in Philip Carrington’s <i>Christian Apologetics of the Second Century,</i> New York, 1921.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.ii-p8">There are several special studies dealing with the theology
and philosophy of Athenagoras: F. Schubring, <i>Die Philosophie des Athenagoras, </i>Berlin, 1882; K. F. Bauer, <i>Die Lehre des Athenagoras von Gottes Einheit und Dreieinigkeit, </i>Bamberg, 1902; L. Richter,

      <h3 id="x.iii.iii-p3.2">THE TEXT</h3>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p4">To the Emperors Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus, conquerors of Armenia and Sarmatia, and—what is more important—philosophers:</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p4.1">Preface</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p5">1. In your Empire, Your Most Excellent Majesties, different peoples observe different laws and customs; and no one is hindered by law or fear of punishment from devotion to his ancestral ways, even if they are ridiculous. A citizen of Troy
calls Hector a god, and worships Helen, taking her for Adrasteia. The Lacedaemonian venerates Agamemnon as Zeus, and Phylonoë, the daughter of Tyndareus, under the name of Enodia. The Athenian sacrifices to Erechtheus as Poseidon. The Athenians also perform religious rites and celebrate
mysteries in honor of Agraulus and Pandrosus, whom they imagine guilty of impiety for opening the box.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p5.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">840</sup></a> In brief, among every nation and people, men perform whatever

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_301"/>  <strong>{Page 301}</strong> sacrifices and mysteries they wish.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p5.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p5.2"><sup class="Note">841</sup></a> The Egyptians reckon among their gods even cats, crocodiles, serpents, asps, and dogs. And to all these cults both you and the laws grant toleration. For you think it impious and wicked to believe in no god at all; and you hold it necessary for everyone to worship the gods he pleases, so that they may be kept from wrongdoing by fear of
the divine. [With us, on the contrary, although you yourselves are not, like the crowd, led astray by rumors, our name is the object of hatred. But names do not deserve to be hated. It is wrongdoing which merits penalty and punishment.]<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p5.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p5.3"><sup class="Note">842</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p6">Accordingly, while everyone admires your mildness and gentleness and your peaceful and kindly attitude toward all, they enjoy equal rights under the law. The cities, according to their rank, share in equal honor, and the whole Empire through your wisdom enjoys profound peace.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p7">But you have not cared for us who are called Christians in this way. Although we do no wrong, but, as we shall show, are of all men most religiously and rightly disposed toward God and your Empire, you allow us to be harassed, plundered, and persecuted, the mob making war on us only because of our name. We venture, therefore, to state our case before you. From what we have to say you will gather that we suffer unjustly and contrary to all law and reason. Hence we ask
you to devise some measures to prevent our being the victims of false accusers.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p8">The injury we suffer from our persecutors does not concern our property or our civil rights or anything of less importance. For we hold these things in contempt, although they appear weighty to the crowd. We have learned not only not to return
blow for blow, nor to sue those who plunder and rob us, but to those who smite us on one cheek to offer the other also, and to those who take away our coat to give our overcoat as well. But when we have given up our property, they plot against our bodies and souls, pouring upon us a multitude of accusations which have not the slightest foundation, but which are the stock in trade of gossips and the like.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p9">2. If, indeed, anyone can convict us of wrongdoing, be it trifling or more serious, we do not beg off punishment, but are prepared to pay the penalty however cruel and unpitying.

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_302"/>  <strong>{Page 302}</strong> But if the accusation goes no farther than a name—and it is clear that up to today the tales about us rest only on popular and uncritical rumor, and not a single Christian has been convicted of wrongdoing—it is your duty, illustrious, kind, and most learned Emperors, to relieve us of these calumnies by law. Thus, as the whole world, both individuals and cities, shares your kindness, we too may be grateful to you, rejoicing
that we have ceased to be defamed.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p10">It does not befit your sense of justice that others, accused of wrongdoing, are not punished before they have been convicted, while with us the mere name is of more weight than legal proof. Our judges, moreover, do not inquire if the accused has
committed any wrong, but let loose against the name as if it were a crime. But no name in and of itself is good or bad. It is by reason of the wicked or good actions associated with names that they are bad or good. You know all that better than anyone, seeing you are versed in philosophy and thoroughly cultured.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p11">That is why those who are tried before you, though arraigned on the most serious charges, take courage. For they know that you will examine their life and not be influenced by names if they mean nothing, or by accusations if they are false. Hence
they receive a sentence of condemnation on a par with one of acquittal. We claim for ourselves, therefore, the same treatment as others. We should not be hated and punished because we are called Christians, for what has a name to do with our
being criminals? Rather should we be tried on charges brought against us, and either acquitted on our disproving them or punished on our being convicted as wicked men, not because of a name (for no Christian is wicked unless he is a hypocrite),
but because of a crime.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p12">It is in this way, we know, that philosophers are judged. None of them before the trial is viewed by the judge as good or bad because of his system or profession, but he is punished if he is found guilty. (No stigma attaches to philosophy on that
account, for he is a bad man for not being a philosopher lawfully, and philosophy is not responsible.) On the other hand, he is acquitted if he disproves the charges. Let the same procedure be used in our case. Let the life of those who are accused
be examined, and let the name be free from all reproach.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p13">I must at the outset of my defense beg you, illustrious Emperors, to hear me impartially. Do not prejudge the case through being influenced by popular and unfounded rumor,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_303"/>  <strong>{Page 303}</strong> but apply your love of learning and of truth to our cause. Thus you will not be led astray through ignorance, and we, disproving the uncritical rumors of the crowd, shall
cease to be persecuted.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p13.1">Statement of the Charges</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p14">3. Three charges are brought against us: atheism, Thyestean feasts,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p14.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p14.1"><sup class="Note">843</sup></a> and Oedipean intercourse.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p14.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p14.2"><sup class="Note">844</sup></a> If these are true, spare no class; proceed against our crimes; destroy us utterly with
our wives and children, if anyone lives like a beast. Beasts, indeed, do not attack their own kind. Nor for mere wantonness do they have intercourse, but by nature’s law and only at the season of procreation. They recognize, too, those who come to their aid. If, then, anyone is more savage than brutes, what
punishment shall we not think it fitting for him to suffer for such crimes?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p15">But if these charges are inventions and unfounded slanders, they arise from the fact that it is natural for vice to oppose virtue and it is in accord with God’s law for contraries to war against each other. You yourselves, moreover, are witness to
the fact that we are guilty of none of these things, since it is only the confession of a name that you forbid. It remains for you, then, to examine our lives and teachings, our loyalty and obedience to you, to your house, and to the Empire. By doing
so you will concede to us no more than you grant to our persecutors. And we shall triumph over them, giving up our very lives for the truth without any hesitation.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p15.1">Reply to the Charge  of Atheism</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p16">4. We are of course not atheists (I will meet the charges one by one)—and I hope it does not sound too silly to answer such an allegation. Rightly, indeed, did the Athenians accuse Diagoras<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p16.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p16.1"><sup class="Note">845</sup></a> of atheism, since he not only divulged the Orphic doctrine as well as the mysteries of Eleusis and of the Cabiri and chopped up a statue of Heracles to boil his turnips, but he proclaimed outrightly that God simply did not exist. In our case,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_304"/>  <strong>{Page 304}</strong> however, is it not mad to charge us with atheism, when we distinguish God from matter, and show that matter is one thing and God another, and that there is a vast difference between them? For the divine is uncreated and eternal, grasped only
by pure mind and intelligence, while matter is created and perishable.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p17">If we shared the views of Diagoras when we have so many good reasons to adore God—the order, harmony, greatness, color, form, and arrangement of the world—we should rightly be charged with impiety and there would be due cause to persecute us. But since our teaching affirms one God who made the universe, being himself uncreated (for what exists does not come into being, only what does not exist), and who made all things through his Word, on two scores, then, we are treated unreasonably—by being slandered and by being persecuted.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p17.1">What Poets and Philosophers Have Taught</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p18">5. The poets and philosophers have not been viewed as atheists because they
speculated about God. In connection with those whom popular opinion ignorantly
calls gods, Euripides expresses his embarrassment thus:</p>
      
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p18.2">
“If Zeus dwells in heaven<br/>
He should not deal out misfortunes.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p18.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p18.4"><sup class="Note">846</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote> 
<p class="continue" id="x.iii.iii-p19">But when he gives his view about him who can 
intelligently be known as God, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p19.2">“Do you see him above who embraces<br/>
The boundless sky and the earth with his humid arms?<br/>
Consider him Zeus: regard him as God.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p19.5" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p19.5"><sup class="Note">847</sup></a>
</p>
</blockquote> 

      <p class="skip" id="x.iii.iii-p20">In the case of the former gods he recognized no underlying
reality to which the title “god” might be applied. “For who Zeus is, is
only a matter of words.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p20.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p20.1"><sup class="Note">848</sup></a> He saw too that they were
not given their divine names because of real deeds they

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_305"/>  <strong>{Page 305}</strong> had done; and, since they lack reality, what are they more than names?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p21">But the latter God he recognized from his works, understanding that what is
seen points to what is invisible. . . . Him, then, who is the source of
creation and who governs it by his Spirit, he grasped was God. And Sophocles
agrees with him, saying:</p>
      
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p21.2">
“In truth there is one God, one alone,<br/>
Who made the heaven and the wide earth.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p21.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p21.4"><sup class="Note">849</sup></a>
</p> 
</blockquote> 
      
      <p class="continue" id="x.iii.iii-p22">Hence, with regard to God’s nature, which fills the universe with his beauty, Euripides teaches both the necessity of his existence and his unity.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p23">6. Philolaus too, when he says that everything is enclosed by God as in a prison, teaches his unity and his superiority over matter. Lysis and Opsimus<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p23.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p23.1"><sup class="Note">850</sup></a> define God thus: the former says he is an ineffable number, the latter that he is the difference between the greatest number and the one below it. Since, then, according to the Pythagoreans, the greatest number is ten, that is, the tetractys which contains all the relations of arithmetic and harmony,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p23.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p23.2"><sup class="Note">851</sup></a> and the number next to it is nine, God is a unit, that is, one. For the greatest number exceeds that next to it by one. . . .</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p24">And now regarding Plato and Aristotle. But first let me note that in going through what the philosophers have said about God, I do not intend to give a full review of their opinions. For I know that as you excel all men in intelligence and
imperial power, so you surpass all in your grasp of every branch of learning, mastering them all with more success than those who devote themselves exclusively to one. But as it is impossible without mentioning names to show that we are not alone in limiting the number of the gods to one, I shall rely on collections of maxims.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p25">This is what Plato says: “To discover the creator and father of the universe is difficult, and when you have discovered him it is impossible to tell everybody about him.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p25.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p25.1"><sup class="Note">852</sup></a> In speaking thus, Plato views God as uncreated and eternal. And if he recognizes other gods, such as the sun, the moon, and the stars, he recognizes them as created, saying: “Gods that are sons of

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_306"/>  <strong>{Page 306}</strong> gods, I am their creator. I am the father of works which are indissoluble only so far as I will it, for all things which are composed are corruptible.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p25.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p25.2"><sup class="Note">853</sup></a> If, then, Plato is not an atheist when he considers the one uncreated maker of the universe to be God, neither are we atheists when we recognize and affirm
him to be God by whose Word all things were created and by whose Spirit they are held together.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p26">Aristotle and his followers introduce a single principle, a sort of compound being, composed of body and soul, and say that he is God. They imagine that his body is the ether, the planets, and the sphere of the fixed stars that are propelled in circles. His soul, on the other hand, is the principle whereby the body is set in motion. Though itself unmoved, the soul becomes the cause of the body’s moving.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p27">The Stoics, too, actually think God is one, though they multiply names for the divine by the terms they use for the variations of matter, which they say is permeated by God’s spirit. For if God is a creative fire, methodically fashioning the world and embracing in himself all the seminal principles by which each thing is produced in accordance with fate, and if his Spirit pervades the universe, then in their doctrine
he is one. He is called Zeus with regard to the fervid part of matter, and Hera with regard to the air; while his other titles similarly refer to each special part of matter which he pervades.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p28">7. All philosophers, then, even if unwillingly, reach complete agreement about the unity of God when they come to inquire into the first principles of the universe. We too affirm that he who arranged this universe is God. Why, therefore, are they
allowed to speak and write freely about God as they wish, while against us, who can adduce true proofs and reasons for our idea and right conviction of the unity of God, a law is put in force?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p29">Here as elsewhere the poets and philosophers have proceeded by conjecture. They were driven each by his own soul and through a sympathy with the divine spirit to see if it were possible to find out and to comprehend the truth. They were able, indeed, to get some notions of reality, but not to find it, since they did not deign to learn about God from God, but each one from himself. For this reason they taught conflicting doctrines about God, matter, forms, and the world.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p30">We, on the contrary, as witnesses of what we think and believe, have prophets who have spoken by the divine Spirit

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_307"/>  <strong>{Page 307}</strong> about God and the things of God. And you, who excel others in intelligence and in devotion to the true God, would surely admit that we should be acting unreasonably were we to abandon our belief in God’s Spirit, which moved the mouths
of the prophets like instruments, and to cling to human opinions.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p30.1">Rational Proof  for God’s Unity</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p31">8. To grasp the rational basis of our faith, that from the beginning there was one God who made this universe, look at the matter thus. If there were originally two or more gods, they would share in one and the same being or else each would have
an independent being. But for them to share in one and the same being is impossible, since, if they shared the same godhead, they would be alike; but because gods are uncreated they cannot be alike. For it is created things which resemble their patterns, but uncreated things are dissimilar, as they are not created by anyone or for anyone. And if, moreover, it is claimed that, just as hand, eye, and foot are constituent parts of a single body, so God’s unity is made up from two or more gods, this is equally false. Socrates, indeed, was compounded and divided into parts, for the very reason that he was created and perishable. But God is uncreated, impassible, and indivisible. He does not, therefore, consist of parts.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p32">But if, on the other hand, each god has an independent being, and the creator of the world is higher than created things and above what he made and arranged, where can a second god or other gods be? For if the world, being made spherical, is
confined within the circles of the heaven, and if the creator of the world, though above created things, retains the world in his providence, what place is there for a second god or for others? For such a second god is not in the world since it belongs
to another. Nor does he surround the world, since the God who is the creator of the world is above it. If, then, he neither is in the world nor surrounds it, seeing that all space around it is occupied by the creator, where can he be? Is he higher
than the world and God: is he in and around another world? If so, then he is no concern of ours, for he does not control this world; nor does he have great power, for he dwells in a limited space. And if he is neither in another world (for all things are filled by the creator), nor around another world (for all space is occupied by the creator), then he does not exist; for there is nowhere where he can be.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_308"/>  <strong>{Page 308}</strong> 
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p33">What, moreover, would this second god have to do, seeing that another owns the world and that, while he is above the creator of the world, he is neither in the world nor around it? [Is there, then, some other place where he can stand—this god
who has arisen in opposition to the true God? But God and what belongs to God are above him. And what place shall he have, seeing that the creator fills the regions above the world?]<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p33.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p33.1"><sup class="Note">854</sup></a> Would he perhaps exercise providence? Certainly not, unless he were the creator. If, therefore, he does not create or exercise providence, and if there is no place where he can dwell, then from the beginning there has been one God and one alone, the
creator of the world.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p33.2">Proof from Scripture</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p34">9. Were we satisfied with such reasoning, one would think our doctrine was human. But prophetic voices confirm our arguments. Seeing how learned and well-informed you are, I suppose that you are not unaware of Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the rest of the prophets. Under the impulse of the divine Spirit and raised above their own thoughts, they proclaimed the things with which they were inspired. For the Spirit used them just as a flute player blows on a flute. What, then, did they say? “The Lord is our God: no other can be compared with him.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p34.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p34.1"><sup class="Note">855</sup></a> Or again, “I am God the first and the last; and apart from me there is no god.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p34.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p34.3"><sup class="Note">856</sup></a> Similarly: “Before me there was no other god, and after me there shall be none. I
am God, and there is none besides me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p34.5" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p34.5"><sup class="Note">857</sup></a> Then, concerning his greatness: “Heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool.
What kind of house will you build for me, or in what place shall I rest?”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p34.7" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p34.7"><sup class="Note">858</sup></a> But I leave it to you, when you come on their books, to examine their prophecies in more detail, so that you will have good reason to dispel the false accusations brought

      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p34.9">The Trinity</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p35">10. I have sufficiently shown that we are not atheists since we acknowledge one God, who is uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible, incomprehensible, illimitable. He is grasped only by mind and intelligence, and surrounded by light, beauty,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_309"/>  <strong>{Page 309}</strong> spirit, and indescribable power. By him the universe was created through his Word, was set in order, and is held together. [I say “his Word”], for we also think that God has a Son.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p36">Let no one think it stupid for me to say that God has a Son. For we do not think of God the Father or of the Son in the way of the poets, who weave their myths by showing that gods are no better than men. But the Son of God is his Word in idea and in actuality; for by him and through him all things were made, the Father and the Son being one. And since the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son by the unity and power of the Spirit, the Son of God is the mind and Word of the Father.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p37">But if, owing to your sharp intelligence, it occurs to you to inquire further what is meant by the Son, I shall briefly explain. He is the first offspring of the Father. I do not mean that he was created, for, since God is eternal mind, he had his Word within himself from the beginning, being eternally wise.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p37.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p37.1"><sup class="Note">859</sup></a> Rather did the Son come forth from God to give form and actuality to all material things, which essentially have a sort of formless nature and inert quality, the heavier particles being mixed up with the lighter. The prophetic Spirit agrees with this opinion when he says, “The Lord created me as the first of his ways, for his works.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p37.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p37.2"><sup class="Note">860</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p38">Indeed we say that the Holy Spirit himself, who inspires those who utter prophecies, is an effluence from God, flowing from him and returning like a ray of the sun. Who, then, would not be astonished to hear those called atheists who admit God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and who teach their unity in power and their distinction in rank? Nor is our theology confined to these points. We affirm, too,
a crowd of angels and ministers, whom God, the maker and creator of the world, appointed to their several tasks through his Word. He gave them charge over the good order of the universe, over the elements, the heavens, the world, and all it contains.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p38.1">Christian Moral Teaching</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p39">Do not be surprised that I go into detail about our teaching. I give a full report to prevent your being carried away by popular and irrational opinion, and so that you may know the truth. Moreover, by showing that the teachings themselves,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_310"/>  <strong>{Page 310}</strong> to which we are attached, are not human, but were declared and taught by God, we can persuade you not to hold us for atheists. What, then, are these teachings in which we are reared? “I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse
you, pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and sends his rain on the just and on the unjust.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p39.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p39.1"><sup class="Note">861</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p40">Although what I have said has raised a loud clamor,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p40.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p40.1"><sup class="Note">862</sup></a> permit me here to proceed freely, since I am making my defense to emperors who are philosophers. Who of those who analyze syllogisms, resolve ambiguities, explain etymologies, or [teach] homonyms, synonyms, predicates, axioms, and what
the subject is and what the predicate—who of them do not promise to make their disciples happy through these and similar disciplines? And yet who of them have so purified their own hearts as to love their enemies instead of hating them; instead
of upbraiding those who first insult them (which is certainly more usual), to bless them; and to pray for those who plot against them? On the contrary, they ever persist in delving into the evil mysteries of their sophistry, ever desirous of working some harm, making skill in oratory rather than proof by deeds their business. With us, on the contrary, you will find unlettered people, tradesmen and old women, who, though
unable to express in words the advantages of our teaching, demonstrate by acts the value of their principles. For they do not rehearse speeches, but evidence good deeds. When struck, they do not strike back; when robbed, they do not sue; to those who ask, they give, and they love their neighbors as themselves.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p41">12. If we did not think that a God ruled over the human race, would we live in such purity? The idea is impossible. But since we are persuaded that we must give an account of all our life here to God who made us and the world, we adopt a temperate, generous, and despised way of life. For we think that, even if we lose our lives, we shall suffer here no evil to be compared with the reward we shall receive from the great judge for a gentle, generous, and modest life.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p42">Plato, indeed, has said that Minos and Rhadamanthus<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p42.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p42.1"><sup class="Note">863</sup></a> will judge and punish the wicked; but we say that, even if a man

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_311"/>  <strong>{Page 311}</strong> were Minos or Rhadamanthus or their father, he could not escape God’s judgment.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p43">Then there are those who think that life is this: “Eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p43.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p43.1"><sup class="Note">864</sup></a> They view death as a deep sleep and a forgetting—“sleep and death, twin brothers”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p43.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p43.3"><sup class="Note">865</sup></a> [as the saying goes]. And men think them religious! But there are others who reckon this present life of very little value. They are guided by this alone—to know the true God and his Word, to know the unity of the Father with the Son, the fellowship of
the Father with the Son, what the Spirit is, what unity exists between these three, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, and what is their distinction in unity. These it is who know that the life for which we look is far better than can be told, if we arrive
at it pure from all wrongdoing. These it is whose charity extends to the point of loving not only their friends, for, the Scripture says, “If you love those who love you, and lend to those who lend to you, what credit is it to you?”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p43.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p43.4"><sup class="Note">866</sup></a> Since we are such and live this way to escape condemnation, can anyone
doubt that we are religious?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p44">These points, however, are trifles from a great store, a few taken from many, lest we should trouble you further. For those who test honey and whey judge by a taste if the whole is good.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p44.1">The Problem  of Pagan Sacrifices</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p45">13. Since many of those who charge us with atheism do not have the vaguest idea of God, being unversed in, and ignorant of, physics and theology, they measure religion by the observance of sacrifices, and charge us with not having the same gods
as the cities. Heed what I have to say, Your Majesties, on both these counts. And first about our not sacrificing.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p46">The creator and Father of the universe does not need blood or the smell
 of burnt offerings or the fragrance of flowers or incense. He himself
is perfect fragrance. He lacks nothing and has need of nothing. But the
 greatest sacrifice in his eyes is for us to realize who stretched out
the heavens in a sphere, who set the earth in the center, who gathered
the water into seas and separated the light from darkness, who adorned
the sky with the stars and made the earth bring forth all kinds of seed,
 who made the animals and fashioned man. When, therefore, we recognize
 God the creator of the universe, who preserves it and watches over it
 with the wisdom and skill he does,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_312"/>  <strong>{Page 312}</strong> and lift up holy hands to him, what need has he then of 
a hecatomb?</p>
      
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p46.2">
“It is with sacrifices and humble prayer,<br/> 
With libation and burnt offering that men implore [the gods]<br/>

</p> 
</blockquote>
      
      <p class="continue" id="x.iii.iii-p47">What need have I of burnt offerings, when God does
not need them? Rather is it needful to present a bloodless sacrifice,
to offer a “spiritual worship.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p47.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p47.1"><sup class="Note">868</sup></a></p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p47.3">Belief in the Traditional Gods</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p48">14. Regarding their other charge, that we neither accept nor venerate the same gods as the cities, it is quite senseless. The very ones who accuse us of atheism for not acknowledging the same gods that they believe in are not agreed among themselves about the gods. The Athenians have set up Celeus and Metanira as gods; the Lacedaemonians, Menelaus—they sacrifice to him and keep his festival; the Trojans cannot bear his name,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p48.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p48.1"><sup class="Note">869</sup></a> and worship Hector; the Ceans adore Aristaeus, imagining he is identical with Zeus and Apollo; the Thasians worship Theagenes, who committed a murder at the Olympian games; the Samians, Lysander for all his slaughter and wickedness! . . .<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p48.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p48.2"><sup class="Note">870</sup></a> The Cilicians worship Niobe; the Sicilians, Philip the son of Boutacides; the Amathusians, Onesilus; the Carthaginians, Hamilcar.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p48.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p48.3"><sup class="Note">871</sup></a> The day is too short to enumerate the rest.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p49">When, then, they fail to agree among themselves about their gods, why do they charge us with disagreeing with them? Take the case of the Egyptians, is it not ridiculous? On their high feasts in the temples they strike their breasts as if lamenting the dead and then sacrifice to them as if they were gods. And it
is no wonder. They worship the brutes as gods, shave themselves when they die, bury them in their temples, and appoint days of public mourning. If we are irreligious for not worshiping the same gods as they, then every city and people is irreligious, for they do not all revere the same gods.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_313"/>  <strong>{Page 313}</strong> 
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p49.1">Idols and Idolatry</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p50">15. But grant that they worship the same gods. What then? Since the populace cannot distinguish between matter and God or appreciate the chasm that separates them, they have recourse to idols made of matter. Shall we, then, who can distinguish and differentiate between uncreated and created, between being and nonbeing, between the intelligible and the sensible, and who call these things by their proper names—shall we, just because of the populace, come and worship
statues? If matter and God are identical, two names for the same thing, we are surely irreligious for not thinking that stones, wood, gold, and silver are gods. But if there is a vast difference between them, as great as separates the craftsman
and his materials, why are we called to account?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p51">It is like the potter and the clay. The clay is matter, the potter is an artist. So is God the creator an artist, while matter is subject to him for the sake of his art. But as clay cannot by itself become pottery without art, so matter, which is altogether pliable, cannot receive distinction, form, or beauty apart from God the creator. We do not, moreover, reckon pottery of more value than the potter, or bowls or vessels of gold than the artisan. If they have artistic merit, we praise the artist. It is he who reaps the renown for making them. So it is with matter and God. It is not matter which justly receives praise and honor for the arrangement and beauty of the world, but its creator, God. If, then, we were to worship material forms as gods, we should seem to be insensitive to the true God, identifying what is eternal with what is subject to dissolution and corruption.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p52">16. Beautiful, indeed, is the world in its all-embracing grandeur, in the arrangement of the stars, both those in the circle of the ecliptic and those at the Septentrion, and in its form as a sphere. Yet it is not the world, but its maker, who should be worshiped.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p53">For when your subjects come to you, they do not fail to pay their homage to you, their lords and masters, from whom they may obtain what they need. They do not have recourse to the magnificence of your palace. When they come upon the royal
residence, they admire it in passing for its beauty and splendor; but it is you whom they honor in every possible way. You emperors, moreover, adorn your palaces for yourselves; but God did not make the world as if he were in need of it. For

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_314"/>  <strong>{Page 314}</strong> he is complete in himself, unapproachable light, perfect beauty, spirit, power, reason.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p54">If, then, the world is an instrument in tune, moving in rhythm, I will worship not the instrument but him who makes the harmony, strikes the notes, and sings the accompanying melody. For the judges at contests do not disregard the lute
players and crown the lutes. If, as Plato says, the world is God’s artistry, I admire its beauty and am directed to the artist. Or if, as the Peripatetics say, the world is a substance and a body, we do not bow down to “the wretched and weak
elements,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p54.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p54.1"><sup class="Note">872</sup></a> neglecting to worship God who is the cause of the body’s motion, and adoring passible matter instead of “impassible spirit” (as they call it). Or again, if someone thinks the parts of the world are powers of God, we do not worship and adore the powers, but their maker and Lord.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p55">I will not beg of matter what it cannot give; I will not pass God by to worship the elements, which can do no more than they are bidden. For even if they are beautiful to behold as the work of their maker, yet are they by the nature of matter corruptible. Plato too bears witness to this view when he says: “For the being we have called heaven and earth shares in many blessings from the Father, but it still partakes of a body. Hence it cannot possibly be free from change.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p55.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p55.1"><sup class="Note">873</sup></a> If, then, I admire the heaven and the elements for their artistry, I do not worship them as gods, for I know they are subject to dissolution. How much less can I call those objects gods, whose makers I know were men?</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p55.2">Recency of the Names  and Statues of the Gods</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p56">17. Hear me briefly on this question. In making my defense I must give more detailed arguments to show that the names of the gods are quite recent, and their statues are, so to say, only of yesterday. You yourselves are thoroughly versed in
these things since more than all others and in all details you are familiar with ancient writers.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p57">I say, then, that it was Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod who gave both genealogies and names to those who are called gods. Herodotus testifies to this: “I think that Hesiod and Homer lived four hundred years before me, no more. It was they who devised a theogony for the Greeks, gave the gods their names, assigned them honors and functions, and described their

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_315"/>  <strong>{Page 315}</strong> forms.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p57.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p57.1"><sup class="Note">874</sup></a> Statues of gods, moreover, were unthought of
before the plastic arts, painting and sculpture, were invented.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p58">These arts came in later with Saurias the Samian, Crato
the Sicyonian, Cleanthes the Corinthian, and a Corinthian
girl. Drawing was invented by Saurias when he sketched a
horse in the sun;<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p58.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p58.1"><sup class="Note">875</sup></a> and painting by Crato when he traced the outline of a man and a woman in oils on a white surface. It was the girl who invented relief sculpture. When she fell in love with a certain man, she traced his outline on a wall while he was asleep. Her father was so delighted by the extraordinary resemblance that, being a potter, he embossed the sketch by filling up the outline with clay. The figure is still preserved in Corinth. After them Daedalus, Theodorus, and Smilis invented sculpture and the plastic arts.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p59">Thus images and statuary are of such recent date that we can name the artist of each god. The image of Artemis in Ephesus, the one of Athena (or rather of Athela,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p59.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p59.1"><sup class="Note">876</sup></a> for that is what those who speak in a more mystic fashion call her, and that was the
name of the ancient statue made of olive), and another of
Athena seated, are the work of Endoeus, a pupil of Daedalus.
The Pythian god was made by Theodorus and Teleches. The
Delian god and Artemis were fashioned by Tectaeus and
Angelio. The Hera in Samos and the one in Argos are the
handiwork of Smilis. The other images were made by Phidias.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p59.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p59.2"><sup class="Note">877</sup></a> The Aphrodite in Cnidus is a product of Praxiteles, while the Asclepius in Epidaurus is the work of Phidias.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p60">In a word, there is not one of these statues but has been made by a man. If, then, these are gods, why did they not exist from the beginning? Why are they more recent than those who made them? Why did they need the aid of man and of art to come into existence? They are nothing but earth, stones, matter, and paltry art.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p60.1">The Gods Were Created</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p61">18. Some, however, say that these are only statues, but that the gods, in whose honor they are made, are real. To them the processions to the images and the sacrifices have reference. These actions are directed toward the gods, since there is no other way of approaching them.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_316"/>  <strong>{Page 316}</strong> 
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p62">“The direct vision of the gods is hard to bear.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p62.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p62.1"><sup class="Note">878</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p63">As a proof that this is so these people bring forward the powers which some of the images have. Come then, let us look into the power of their names. But before I proceed I would beg Your Most Excellent Majesties to excuse me if I adduce
convincing arguments. It is not my first intention to unmask the idols; rather is it to refute the slanders brought against us. It is for that reason that I set forth the rationale of our principles. Would that you might by yourselves search out the heavenly Kingdom! For to you, father and son, all things are subject, since you have received the kingdom from above. For “the soul of the king is in God’s hand,” as the, prophetic Spirit says.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p63.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p63.1"><sup class="Note">879</sup></a> In the same way all things are subject to the one God and to his Word—to his Son, that is—whom we think of as inseparable from him.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p64">This, then, I especially ask you to heed. The gods, as it is generally held, did not exist from the beginning. Each of them was created, just as we were. With this view everyone agrees. Homer, for instance, says,</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p65">“Oceanus, the father of the gods and Tethys their mother.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p65.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p65.1"><sup class="Note">880</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p66">Then take Orpheus.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p66.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p66.1"><sup class="Note">881</sup></a> He was the first to give the gods names. He recounted their genealogies and their several exploits, and is viewed by our accusers as a rather reliable theologian. Homer
mostly follows him, especially in his references to the gods. He asserts that they owed their origin to water: “Oceanus, who is the origin of everything.” For, according to him, water was the beginning of everything.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p67">From water mud was formed; and from these an animal was produced, a dragon that had on it a lion’s head and a bull’s head, and in between the face of a god. It was called Heracles and Kronos. This Heracles gave birth to an enormous
egg, which through the power of its father got bigger and bigger and by friction was burst into two. The top part came to be the Heaven (<i>Ouranos</i>); the lower became Earth (<i>Gē</i>). Thus there came forth a divine being with two bodies. Ouranos had intercourse with Gē and begat the females, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p67.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p67.1"><sup class="Note">882</sup></a> and the males, Cottys, Gyges, and Briareus, all hundred-handed,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p67.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p67.2"><sup class="Note">883</sup></a> and the Cyclopes—Brontes,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_317"/>  <strong>{Page 317}</strong> Steropes, and Arges. These he bound and hurled to Tartarus,
because he had learned from the beginning that he would be
dethroned by his children. Whereupon Earth in her rage gave
birth to the Titans.</p>
      
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p67.4">
“The godlike Gaia bore sons to Heaven,<br/>
Who bear the name of Titans,<br/>

</p>
</blockquote>
      
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p68">19. Such is the origin of their gods and of the universe. Now
what are we to make of this? For each of the beings to whom
they attribute divinity has had a beginning.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p68.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p68.1"><sup class="Note">885</sup></a> If they did not exist before they were created (as those claim who attribute divinity to them), then they do not exist now. For either a
thing is uncreated and eternal, or it is created and corruptible.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p69">What I am saying is not at variance with what the philosophers say. “What is that which is eternal and has no origin; or what is that which is created and never truly existed?”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p69.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p69.1"><sup class="Note">886</sup></a> Plato is here discussing the intelligible and the sensible: He teaches that the eternal, the intelligible, is uncreated, while the sensible has a beginning and an end. In the same way the Stoics contend that the universe will be burned up and exist all over again; and so the world will have a new beginning.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p70">Moreover, suppose we grant their thesis of two principles, one active and governing, which is providence, the other passive and changeable, which is matter. Then the world, even though subject to providence, cannot remain unchanging, because it is created. How, then, can the nature of the gods remain unaltered, when they do not have essential being but are created? And wherein are the gods superior to matter, since they derive their nature from water? But not even water, according to them, is the origin of everything. For what could be constituted from simple and homogeneous elements? Moreover, matter requires an artisan, and an artisan matter. Or how
could statues exist without both matter and artisan? On the other
hand, it is unreasonable that matter should be older than God: for the efficient cause must necessarily precede what is created.</p>

      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p70.1">The Forms  and Exploits of the Gods</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p71">20. I would pass on to the other charges [our accusers bring against
us], did the absurdity of their theology reach no farther than the
statement that the gods derive their nature from water; for I have
already shown that there is nothing created which is not subject to
dissolution. But they go farther and describe their bodies. They speak of
Heracles as a god in the form of a coiled-up dragon. Others
are hundred-handed. The daughter of Zeus, born of his mother
Rhea who is also named Demeter, has two eyes
in their natural place and two others in her forehead. In addition,
she has the face of an animal on the back part of her neck, and horns
as well. Hence Rhea, terrified at such a monster for a
child, fled from her and withheld her breast. For this reason she is
mystically called Athela,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p71.7" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p71.7"><sup class="Note">887</sup></a>
though more usually Persephone and Kore.
She must not, however, be confused with Athena, who is
named “Kore” from her virginity.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p71.12" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p71.12"><sup class="Note">888</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p72">They have, furthermore, described
their exploits with a wealth of supposed detail. They say that
Kronos castrated his father, and hurled him out of a
chariot. They tell, too, how he murdered his children and swallowed
the male ones. Zeus bound his father and cast him into
Tartarus, just as Ouranos did to his sons. He warred
against the Titans for supremacy, and persecuted his
mother Rhea for refusing to marry him. When, indeed,
she became a dragon, he changed himself into one, bound her with the
so-called Herculean knot, and raped her. The rod of Hermes is a symbol
of that union. Then he raped his daughter Persephone,

noble or valuable in these tales as to make us believe that

      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p95.6">The Natural Theology  of the Myths</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p96">22. But perhaps this sort of thing is poetic license, and there
is a natural explanation of it, such as this by Empedocles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p96.3">
“Zeus is brightness, and Hera source of life, along with Aïdoneus<br/>
And Nestis who bathes with tears the eyes of mortals.”
</p>
</blockquote>
      
      <p class="continue" id="x.iii.iii-p97">If, then, Zeus is fire, Hera the earth, Aïdoneus the air, and Nestis water, and these (fire, water, and air) are elements, then
none of them—Zeus, Hera, or Aïdoneus—is a god. For the
nature and origin of these elements is derived from God’s
separating matter into its different parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="t1" id="x.iii.iii-p97.6">
“Fire and water and earth and the gentle height of the air,<br/>
And love along with them. . . .”
</p>
</blockquote>
      
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p98">How can anyone call those things gods which need love in
order to exist and which collapse through discord? According
to Empedocles, love is primary. Compounds are derived from
it, and it is the governing principle. In this way, if we identify
the power of the principle with the power of what is derived
from it, we unintentionally equate God, who is uncreated,
eternal, and ever self-harmonious, with matter, which is corruptible, fluctuating, and changeable.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p99">According to the Stoics, Zeus is the fiery substance, Hera the air (you get this by doubling the name), and Poseidon is
water.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p99.5" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p99.5"><sup class="Note">909</sup></a> Others give different natural explanations. Some hold
that Zeus is the air and has a double nature, masculine and
feminine. Others contend that he is the time of year which
brings mild weather, whence he alone escaped from Kronos.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p99.11" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p99.11"><sup class="Note">910</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p100">To the Stoics, however, we may reply as follows: You think
that there is one God above, uncreated and eternal, and that
there are a number of compounds into which matter is changed.
You say, furthermore, that the spirit of God pervades matter
and takes on different names in accordance with its variations.
Hence the forms of matter constitute God’s body. These forms
and the names of God with them must eventually be done away
with, since the elements will be destroyed by fire. Only the
spirit of God will then remain. But who, in the light of this,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_323"/>  <strong>{Page 323}</strong> would believe those bodies to be gods whose material changes
end in destruction?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p101">Then, again, there are those who say that Kronos is time
and Rhea earth. (The myth goes that she became pregnant
by Kronos and gave birth, and so is viewed as the mother of all;
and that he bore children and devoured them.) They explain
the castration [in the myth] as intercourse between male and
female, which cuts off’ the sperm and casts it into the womb
and begets a human being who has sexual desire (i.e., Aphrodite)
in himself. They further expound the madness of Kronos
as the change of season, which brings destruction to animate
and inanimate things alike. The bonds [of Kronos] and Tartarus<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p101.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p101.1"><sup class="Note">911</sup></a> are time which changes with the seasons and disappears. To all this we reply: if Kronos is time, he changes.
If he is the seasons, he alternates. If he is darkness or ice or
moisture, they all pass away. But the divine is immortal,
immovable, and immutable. Hence neither Kronos nor his
idol is God.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p102">And concerning Zeus again, if he is the air created by
Kronos whose male part is Zeus as Hera is his female part
(whence she is both his sister and his wife), then he is subject
to change. If he is the seasons, he varies. But the divine never
changes or alters.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p103">But why should I trouble you further with such accounts?
You are well acquainted with the views of those who adduce
these natural explanations. You know what the different writers
have thought about the nature of the gods. About Athena,
whom they consider to be the wisdom which pervades all
things. Or about Isis, who they say is eternal being from which
all are derived and through which they continue to exist. Or
about Osiris, who was murdered by his brother Typhon, . . .
and whose limbs Isis searched for with her son Horus. On
finding them, she buried them in a tomb which is still called
“Osiriake.”</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p104">Since these thinkers are forever concentrating on the forms
of matter, they miss the God who is known only by reason.
They make gods out of the elements or parts of them, at different
times giving them different names. Osiris, for instance, is the
sowing of the wheat. For this reason, so they say, when his
members or the ears of wheat are discovered in the course of
the mysteries, Isis is thus addressed: “We have found, we


<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_324"/>  <strong>{Page 324}</strong> rejoice.” Again, Dionysus is the fruit of the vine. . . . Semele
is the vine itself, while the thunderbolt [of Zeus] is the sun’s
warmth.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p104.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p104.1"><sup class="Note">912</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p105">In fact, those who make real gods out of the myths do everything rather than form a true theology. For they fail to realize
that by the very defense they make of their gods, they only
confirm the reproaches brought against them. For what have
Europa, the Bull, the Swan, and Leda to do with the earth and
the air, so that Zeus’s foul intercourse with these women should
represent the relation of the earth to the air? The greatness of
God escapes them and they are incapable of exercising their
reason, for they have no sympathy for the heavenly realm.
Bound to the forms of matter, they fall so low as to deify the
changes of the elements. They resemble a passenger who
would take the place of the helmsman and steer the boat in
which he sailed. And as a ship without its helmsman is no longer
serviceable, no matter how well it is fitted out, so the elements,
though set in careful order, are of no avail without God’s
providence. For a ship does not sail by itself, and the elements
are not set in motion apart from the creator.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p105.1">Why Some Statues Have Power</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p106">23. Since you surpass all men in understanding, you may
ask, “Why is it that some of the idols have power, if the gods
to whom these statues are erected do not exist?” For it is unlikely that lifeless and motionless images should have any power
by themselves without someone being responsible.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p107">We do not deny that in different places, cities, and nations; some mighty
acts have been done in the name of idols. We do not, however, imagine that they
are gods who bring about these effects, whether for the benefit of some or for
the harm of others. Rather have we made a careful inquiry why it is that you
think the idols have power, and who it is that do these things, masquerading
under the names of the gods: In proceeding to show who they are that act in the name of the idols,
and that they are not gods, I will have to avail myself of some
testimonies from the philosophers.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p108">The first of these is Thales. According to those who have
studied him thoroughly, he distinguishes between God, demons,
and heroes. God he recognizes as the cosmic Intelligence. By
demons he understands beings with living souls. He thinks



<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_325"/>  <strong>{Page 325}</strong> that heroes are separated souls of men, the good ones being
good souls and the bad ones evil souls.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p109">Plato, for his part, while not agreeing in other respects,
also distinguishes between the uncreated God, the beings
created by the uncreated to adorn the heaven (the planets and
the fixed stars, that is), and the demons. Concerning the latter
he does not himself claim a right to speak, but thinks it proper
for us to heed what others have said about them.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p110">“Concerning the other demons,” he writes, “to tell and to know their origin
is beyond our capacity. But we should trust those who have spoken about them
before us, and who, they say, are descendants of the gods. For they obviously
must have been well acquainted with their parents. We cannot, therefore,
disbelieve the sons of gods even though they speak without plausible and
convincing proofs. Rather must we, in accordance with custom, believe them, since they profess to speak
about their family affairs. Let us then, hold their view of the
origin of these gods, which we will now propound. Oceanus
and Tethys were the offspring of Gē and Ouranos. From them
came Phorcus, Kronos and Rhea, and the rest. From Kronos
and Rhea came Zeus, Hera, and all those who are said to be
their brothers. From them in turn came other descendants.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p110.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p110.1"><sup class="Note">913</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p111">Now Plato understood that God was eternal and to be
grasped by intelligence and reason. He declared his attributes,
how he is essential being, how he has a single nature and is the
source of goodness, which is truth. He discoursed about the
primal power, . . . [and said:] “All things encircle the King
of the universe. They exist because of him and he is the cause
of everything.” He told further about a second and third cause,
“the second surrounding the second realm, the third surrounding the third.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p111.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p111.1"><sup class="Note">914</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p112">Would such a man imagine that to learn the truth of those
beings which are said to be derived from sensible things, i.e.,
from the earth and the heaven, was something beyond his
capacity? Certainly not. He was unable to admit or to teach
that gods were born; and for two reasons he said that it was
beyond his capacity to know or express anything about the
origin of the other demons. It was impossible for him to imagine
that the gods either begat or were begotten, since everything
created comes to an end. It was even more impossible to
change the opinions of the multitude who accepted the myths
uncritically.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_326"/>  <strong>{Page 326}</strong> 
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p113">Plato makes this further statement: “Zeus, the great sovereign
in heaven, driving his winged chariot, is the first to go forth,
setting all things in order and giving heed to them. There
follows him a host of gods and demons.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p113.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p113.1"><sup class="Note">915</sup></a> This does not have
reference to the Zeus who is said to be born of Kronos. For in
this passage the name is used of the Creator of the universe.
Plato himself makes this clear. As he had no other way of
addressing him, he used the popular title, not as if it were
really appropriate for God, but for the sake of clarity. For it
is not possible to explain fully about God to everyone. He also
added the epithet “great,” so as to distinguish the heavenly
Zeus from the earthly, the uncreated from the created. The
latter is younger than heaven and earth, and younger even
than the Cretans who stole him away so he would not be slain
by his father.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p113.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p113.2"><sup class="Note">916</sup></a></p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p113.3">The Christian View  of Demons</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p114">24. Since you have looked into all such arguments, why
should I mention the poets or review other opinions? But let
this suffice. Even if the poets and philosophers had not recognized the unity of God and explained these so-called gods
sometimes as demons, sometimes as matter, and sometimes
as men who once lived, would there be any good reason for
persecuting us, because we distinguish between God and
matter and between their essences?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p115">We speak of God, of the Son, his Word, and of the Holy
Spirit; and we say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are
united in power.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p115.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p115.1"><sup class="Note">917</sup></a> For the Son is the intelligence, reason, and
wisdom of the Father, and the Spirit is an effluence, as light
from fire. In the same way we recognize that there are other
powers which surround matter and pervade it. Of these there
is one in particular which is hostile to God. We do not mean
that there is anything which is opposed to God in the way that
Empedocles opposes strife to love and night to day in the phenomenal world. For even if anything did manage to set itself
up against God, it would cease to exist. It would fall to pieces
by the power and might of God. Rather do we mean that the
spirit which inhabits matter is opposed to God’s goodness,

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_327"/>  <strong>{Page 327}</strong> which is an essential quality with him and coexists with him
as color is inseparable from a body and cannot exist without it.
I do not mean it is a part of him, but it is a necessary accompaniment which is united and fused with him as red is with
fire and blue is with the sky. This opposing spirit was created
by God, just as the other angels were created by him and
entrusted with administering matter and its forms.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p116">For God made these angels to exercise providence over the
things he had set in order. Thus, while he reserved for himself
the universal and general providence over everything, the
angels exercise a particular providence over the parts entrusted
to them.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p117">Just as men have free will to choose good or evil (for you
would not praise the good and punish the wicked, if vice and
virtue were not in their power), and some turn out diligent in
the tasks you give them and others faithless, so it is with the
angels. Some—and God created them with free will—remained
obedient in the tasks for which they were made and appointed.
But others violated their very nature and office. Among them
was this prince of matter and its forms, and others who were
set in the first firmament. (You will note that we say nothing
without authority and speak only of what the prophets have
told).<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p117.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p117.1"><sup class="Note">918</sup></a> These latter angels fell into lusting after virgins and became slaves of the flesh, while the prince of matter became negligent and wicked in managing what was entrusted to him. From those who had intercourse with the virgins were begotten the so-called giants. That even the poets have something to say of the giants should not surprise you. For worldly wisdom differs [from divine]<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p117.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p117.3"><sup class="Note">919</sup></a> just to the measure that truth differs from plausibility. While the one is of heaven, the other is of earth; yet, according to the prince of matter himself, “We know how to tell many lies that resemble the truth.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p117.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p117.4"><sup class="Note">920</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p118">25. Those angels, then, which fell from the heavens, haunt
the air and the earth and are no longer able to rise to heavenly
things. Along with the souls of the giants, they are the demons
which wander about the world. Of these there are two classes:
the demons proper,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p118.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p118.1"><sup class="Note">921</sup></a> who act in accordance with the natures they have received; and the angels, who act in accordance

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_328"/>  <strong>{Page 328}</strong> with the lusts they indulged. The prince of matter,
moreover, as is clear from what happened, rules and governs in opposition
to the goodness of God.

affect men, some in one way, some in another. They influence them within

 according to the principle of matter and to the principle of harmony

      <p id="x.iii.iii-p122">For this reason some, who have no small reputation, have imagined that
this universe was not constituted in an orderly manner, but is impelled
by blind fate. They failed to recognize that there is nothing in the
constitution of the whole world which is disorderly or neglected. Each
part has its origin in reason, and hence none of them violates its
appointed order. Man too, so far as his Maker goes, is a well-ordered
being. With regard to the way he is born, it is one and the same for
all. With regard to the constitution of his body, it does not overstep
its appointed bounds. With regard to the end of his life, he


<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_329"/>  <strong>{Page 329}</strong> shares this in common with all. But so far as their
individuality goes, and in view of the influence exerted by the prince
[of matter] and his demonic cohorts, men are driven in various directions,
although they all share in a common reason.</p>

to idols. They are eager for the blood of sacrifices and lick them up. But
the gods in whom the crowd delights and after whom the statues are named
were really men, as you
 can tell from the stories about them. The fact,
however, that the demons operate under their names is clear from their
individual acts. For some engage in castration, as the devotees of Rhea;
others stab and slash, as those of Artemis. (Artemis of
 Tauris even
murders all strangers!) But I will pass over those who lacerate themselves
with knives and scourges of bones, and the various kinds of demons.</p>

      <p id="x.iii.iii-p126">But the greatest proof that other beings are at work here than those to whom the statues are erected is afforded by Troas and Parium. The former place has statues of Neryllinus; a contemporary of ours. Parium has statues of Alexander and
Proteus. Both the tomb and the statue of Alexander are still in the forum. The other statues of Neryllinus are public ornaments, if indeed you can ornament a city in that way: But one of them is thought to utter oracles and to heal the sick. It is for
these reasons that the people of Troas make sacrifices to the
statue, anoint it, and set a golden crown on it.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p127">Regarding the statues of Alexander and of Proteus; the latter is also said to utter oracles. This Proteus, you know, is the one who threw himself into the fire near Olympia. In honor of the statue of Alexander (“O luckless Paris, so fair of form but

27. What then? In the first place, the irrational powers of the soul, which produce fantasies, bring forth all kinds of images. Some they derive from matter. Others they form and project by themselves. The soul experiences this especially when it partakes of the spirit of matter and is mingled with it. It then ceases to fix its eyes on heavenly things and on its creator. It lowers its vision to earthly things. In a word, it becomes just blood and flesh, and is no longer a pure spirit.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p129">
These irrational powers and fantasies of the soul produce visions marked by a passion for idols. A tender and susceptible soul which is ignorant of sound teaching and has no experience in it, having neither contemplated the truth nor reflected upon
the Father and Maker of the universe, is easily impressed with false notions of itself. Hence the demons which haunt matter, eager for the smell and blood of sacrifices, and ready to lead men astray, avail themselves of these capacities for fantasy in the souls of the multitude. Occupying their minds, they pour visions into them, making it seem as if these came from the idols and statues. Moreover, in whatever ways the
soul, because of its immortality, is moved by reason to foretell the future or to heal the present, the demons reap the glory of them all.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p129.1">The Gods Were Originally Men</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p130">28. Perhaps it is necessary, in the light of what we have been saying, to add a word about the names of the gods. Herodotus and Alexander the son of Philip, in his letter to his mother, say that they learned from the Egyptian priests that the gods had once been men. Each of these authors, by the way, is said to have interviewed the priests in Heliopolis, Memphis, and Thebes. This is what Herodotus writes:</p>
      <span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_331"/>  <strong>{Page 331}</strong> 
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p131">“They indicated, then, that those beings whom the statues
represented were of such a nature that they were far from
being gods. But before these men, they said, the Egyptians had
gods for their rulers. They dwelt with men and one of them was
always supreme. The last of these kings was Horus, the son of
Osiris, whom the Greeks call Apollo. He deposed Typhon and
became the last god to rule over Egypt. Osiris is called Dionysus
by the Greeks.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p131.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p131.1"><sup class="Note">929</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p132">The others, then, as well as Osiris, were kings of Egypt; and
it is from them that the Greeks got the names of their gods.
Apollo is the son of Dionysus and Isis. The same Herodotus
writes, “They say that Apollo and Artemis were the children
of Dionysus and Isis, and that Leto became their nurse and
savior.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p132.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p132.1"><sup class="Note">930</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p133">These heavenly beings they had for their first kings. Partly
because they were ignorant of true piety toward the divine, and
partly in gratitude for their rule, they took them, along with
their wives, for gods. “All the Egyptians sacrifice the steers
if they are without blemish and the male calves. But they are
not allowed to sacrifice the cows, as they are sacred to Isis.
The statue of Isis is that of a woman with the horns of a cow,
similar to the way the Greeks depict Io.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p133.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p133.1"><sup class="Note">931</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p134">Who could be more worthy of credence when they make
such statements than those in the family succession? For they
received, son from father, not only the priesthood but the
history of it. It is not likely that the very priests who reverence
the idols would be lying when they say the gods were originally
men. Herodotus, indeed, might perhaps be put down as a
romancer where he tells us that the Egyptians record their
gods were once men, since he also said, “I do not intend to
relate all that I heard of their sacred history, but only the names
of the gods.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p134.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p134.1"><sup class="Note">932</sup></a> But since Alexander and Hermes, surnamed
Trismegistus, and plenty of others whom I will not mention
individually, claim a divine origin for their family, there is no
reason whatever to dispute that the Egyptian kings were considered gods.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p135">That the gods were originally men the most learned of the
Egyptians indicate. While they regard the air, the earth, the
sun, and the moon as gods, they consider the rest of the gods
to have been mortal men and think of the temples as their
tombs. Apollodorus takes this view in his work entitled <i>On the</i>

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_332"/>  <strong>{Page 332}</strong> <i>Gods</i>. Herodotus, furthermore, refers to their sufferings as
mysteries. “I have already spoken of the way they celebrate
the feast of Isis in the city of Busiris. After the sacrifice all the
men and women—vast crowds of them—lament; but in what
connection they do this, it would not be right for me to disclose.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p135.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p135.1"><sup class="Note">933</sup></a> Had they been gods, they would have been immortal.
But if people lament for them, and it is their sufferings which
constitute mysteries, then they are men.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p136">This same Herodotus further remarks: “In Sais, in the temple
of Athena, there is a tomb erected in honor of the god whose
name religious scruples forbid me to mention in this connection.
It stands behind the sanctuary and extends the whole length
of its wall. There is a lake there, which is beautifully encircled
with a stone edging. Its size, I imagine, is that of the lake in
Delos which we call The Circle. It is in this lake that the Egyptians at night perform representations of his passion, which they
refer to as mysteries.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p136.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p136.1"><sup class="Note">934</sup></a> They show you there not only the tomb
of Osiris, but also his mummy. “When a corpse is brought
to them, they show the bearers wooden images of corpses,
realistically painted. The most perfect of them is said to be
that of the god whose name I must not, for religious reasons,
disclose in this connection.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p136.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p136.2"><sup class="Note">935</sup></a></p>

Heracles:</p>

      <p id="x.iii.iii-p148">Thus, if the myths about the gods, which the populace and
the poets repeat, are false, to reverence them is superfluous.
For these gods do not exist if the tales about them are untrue.

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_335"/>  <strong>{Page 335}</strong> If on the other hand, all these stories about the gods are true—their births, loves, murders, thefts, castrations, thunderbolts—then they no longer exist, since they have ceased to be, just as
they originally had no being before they were created. And
what good reason is there to believe some of the tales and to
disbelieve others, since the poets told them in order to idealize
their heroes? For surely those who so magnified them by their
stories that they were taken for gods would not have invented
their sufferings.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p149">That, therefore, we are not atheists, since we worship God
the creator of this universe, and his Word, I have proved as
best I can, even if I have not done the subject justice.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p149.1">Two Further Charges</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p150">31. Our accusers have made up the further charges against
us of impious feasts and intercourse. They do this to convince
themselves that they have grounds for hating us. They imagine,
moreover, that by fear they will either draw us away from our
present mode of life or else, by the enormity of the accusations,
render our princes harsh and implacable. But this is a foolish
approach toward those who realize that of old, and not merely
in our time, wickedness has a habit of warring against virtue,
in obedience to some divine law and principle. Thus, for
instance, Pythagoras with three hundred companions was put
to the flames. Heraclitus and Democritus were banished, the
one from the city of Ephesus, the other, charged with insanity,
from Abdera. Finally, the Athenians condemned Socrates to
death. And just as the virtue of these men suffered no whit
from the opinions of the mob, so our uprightness of life is in
no way obscured by the reckless calumnies of some persons.
For we are in good standing with God.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p151">Nonetheless, I will meet these charges too, although I am very
confident that I have made my case by what I have already
said. You, who are more intelligent than others, know that those
who faithfully regulate their lives by reference to God, so that
each of us stands before him blameless and irreproachable,
will not entertain even the thought of the slightest sin. Were we
convinced that this life is the only one, then we might be
suspected of sinning, by being enslaved to flesh and blood and
by becoming subject to gain and lust. But since we realize
that God is a witness day and night of our thoughts and our
speech, and that by being pure light he can see into our very

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_336"/>  <strong>{Page 336}</strong> hearts, we are convinced that when we depart this present life
we shall live another. It will be better than this one, heavenly,
not earthly. We shall live close to God and with God, our souls
steadfast and free from passion. Even if we have flesh, it will
not seem so: we shall be heavenly spirits. Or else, if we fall along with the rest, we shall enter on a worse life and one in flames. For God did not make us like sheep and oxen, a bywork to perish and be done away with. In the light of this it is not likely that we would be purposely wicked, and deliver ourselves up to the great Judge to be punished.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p151.1">The Charge  of Incest</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p152">32. It is nothing surprising that our accusers should invent the same tales about us that they tell of their gods. They present their sufferings as mysteries; and, had they wanted to judge shameless and indiscriminate intercourse as a frightful thing,
they should have hated Zeus. For he had children from his mother, Rhea, and his daughter Kore, and married his own sister. Or else, they should have detested Orpheus, who invented these tales, because he made Zeus even more unholy and wicked than Thyestes. For the latter had intercourse with his daughter in pursuance of an oracle, and because he wanted to gain a throne and avenge himself.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p153">But we, on the contrary, are so far from viewing such crimes with indifference<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p153.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p153.1"><sup class="Note">949</sup></a> that we are not even allowed to indulge a lustful glance. For, says the Scripture, “He who looks at a woman lustfully, has already committed adultery in his heart.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p153.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p153.2"><sup class="Note">950</sup></a> We may look only on those things for which God created the eyes to be our light. For us a lustful glance is adultery, the eyes being made for other purposes. How, then, in the light of this and of the fact that we shall be called to account for even our thoughts, can it be doubted that we exercise self-control?</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p154">We do not have to reckon with human laws, which a wicked man may evade. (At the outset I assured you, Your Majesties, that our teaching came from God.) Rather do we have a law which requires us to have right relations with ourselves and with our neighbors.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p154.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p154.1"><sup class="Note">951</sup></a> Hence, according to their age, we think of some as sons and daughters. Others we regard as brothers and sisters, while we revere those who are older as we would

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_337"/>  <strong>{Page 337}</strong> fathers and mothers. We feel it a matter of great importance that those, whom we thus think of as brothers and sisters and so on, should keep their bodies undefiled and uncorrupted. For the Scripture says again, “If anyone kisses a second time
because he found it enjoyable . . .”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p154.2" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p154.2"><sup class="Note">952</sup></a> Thus the kiss, or rather the religious salutation,<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p154.3" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p154.3"><sup class="Note">953</sup></a> should be very carefully guarded. For if it is defiled by the slightest evil thought, it excludes us from eternal life.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p155">33. Having, therefore, the hope of eternal life, we despise the enjoyments of the present, even the pleasures of the soul. According to our laws, each of us thinks of the woman he has married as his wife only for the purpose of bearing children. For as the farmer casts his seed on the soil and awaits the harvest without sowing over it, so we limit the pleasure of intercourse to bearing children.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p156">You would, indeed, find many among us, both men and women, who have grown to old age unmarried, in the hope of being closer to God. If, then, to remain virgins and eunuchs brings us closer to God, while to indulge in wrong thoughts and passions drives us from him, we have all the more reason to avoid those acts, the very thought of which we flee from. For we center our attention not on the skill of making speeches but on the proof and lessons of actions. We hold that a man should either remain as he is born or else marry only once. For a second marriage is a veiled adultery. The Scripture says, “Whoever puts away his wife and marries another, commits adultery.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p156.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p156.1"><sup class="Note">954</sup></a> Thus a man is forbidden both to put her away whose virginity he has ended, and to marry again. He who severs himself from his first wife, even if she is dead, is an
adulterer in disguise. He resists the hand of God, for in the beginning God created one man and one woman. But the adulterer breaks the fellowship based on the union of flesh with flesh for sexual intercourse.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p156.4" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p156.4"><sup class="Note">955</sup></a></p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p157">34. Since we are such (and why should I speak of such degrading things?), our situation resembles that of the proverb, “The harlot reproves the chaste.” Our accusers have set up a market for fornication, have established infamous houses of
every sort of shameful pleasure for the young, and do not even spare the males, “males committing shocking acts with

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_338"/>  <strong>{Page 338}</strong> males.”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p157.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p157.1"><sup class="Note">956</sup></a> In all sorts of ways they outrage those with the more
graceful and handsome bodies. They dishonor God’s splendid
creation, for beauty on earth is not self-made, but has been
created by the hand and mind of God. It is these people who
revile us with the very things they are conscious of in themselves
and which they attribute to their gods. They boast of them
indeed, as noble acts and worthy of the gods. Adulterers and
corrupters of boys, they insult eunuchs and those once married.
They even live like fish. For they gulp down whatever comes
their way. The stronger chase the weaker. That means they
outrage human flesh, even while the laws are in force which
you and your forefathers carefully enacted in view of all that is
right. To these very laws they do such violence that the
governors appointed by you over the provinces are not able
to keep order. We, however, cannot refrain from turning the
cheek when we are struck, nor from blessing when we are
reviled. For it is not enough to be just—justice consisting in
returning blows—but we have to be generous and to put up
with evil.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p157.3">The Charge  of Cannibalism</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p158">35. Since this is our character, what man of sound judgment
would say that we are murderers? For you cannot eat human
flesh until you have killed someone. If their first charge
against us is a fiction, so is the second. For if anyone were to
ask them if they had seen what they affirm, none of them would
be so shameless as to say he had.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p159">Moreover, we have slaves: some of us more, some fewer. We
cannot hide anything from them; yet not one of them has made
up such tall stories against us. Since they know that we cannot
endure to see a man being put to death even justly, who of
them would charge us with murder or cannibalism? Who
among our accusers<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p159.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p159.1"><sup class="Note">957</sup></a> is not eager to witness contests of gladiators and wild beasts, especially those organized by you? But
we see little difference between watching a man being put to
death and killing him. So we have given up such spectacles.
How can we commit murder when we will not look at it,
lest we should contract the stain of guilt? What reason would
we have to commit murder when we say that women who
induce abortions are murderers, and will have to give account
of it to God? For the same person would not regard the fetus
in the womb as a living thing and therefore an object of God’s

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_339"/>  <strong>{Page 339}</strong> care, and at the same time slay it, once it had come to life. Nor would he refuse to expose infants, on the ground that those who expose them are murderers of children, and at the same time do away with the child he has reared. But we are altogether consistent in our conduct. We obey reason and do not override it.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p159.2">Relevance of the Doctrine  of the Resurrection</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p160">36. What man, moreoever, who is convinced of the resurrection would make himself into a tomb for bodies that will rise again? The same persons would surely not believe that our bodies will rise again and then eat them as if there were no resurrection. They would not think that the earth will give back its dead and then imagine that it will fail to demand those entombed in them.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p161">On the contrary, those who deny they will have to give account of the present life, be it wicked or good, who reject the resurrection and who count on the soul’s perishing along with the body and, so to say, flickering out, are likely to stop
at no outrage. But those who are convinced that God will look into everything and that the body which has aided the soul in its unreasonable lusts and passions will be punished along with it, they have no good reason to commit even the slightest sin.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p162">But suppose someone thinks it sheer nonsense that the body
which has rotted, decomposed, and been reduced to nothing,
should again be put together. Those who do not believe this
would be wrong in accusing us of wickedness. They should rather accuse us of folly. For we do not harm anyone by having mistaken opinions.</p>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p163">
It would be out of place here to show that we are not alone
in believing bodies will rise again. Many of the philosophers
have taught this. But we do not want to seem to introduce
matters beyond the scope of our present task. We will not discuss
the intelligible and the sensible and their natures. Nor the
fact that the incorporeal is prior to the corporeal, and the
intelligible precedes the sensible. It is true, of course, that we
first experience the sensible; but the corporeal owes its origin
to the incorporeal by being combined with the intelligible.
The sensible similarly owes its origin to the intelligible.<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p163.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p163.1"><sup class="Note">958</sup></a> Even according to Pythagoras and Plato the dissolution of the

<span class="pb" id="x.iii.iii-Page_340"/>  <strong>{Page 340}</strong> body does not prevent it from being reconstructed with the very elements of which it originally consisted.</p>
      <h4 id="x.iii.iii-p163.2">Conclusion</h4>
      <p id="x.iii.iii-p164">37. But we must defer our discussion of the resurrection. Now that I have disposed of the charges brought against us and shown that we are religious, kindly, and gentle in spirit, I beg you, grant your royal approval to my request. For in every possible way, by nature as well as education, you are kind, temperate, generous, and worthy of the imperium. And who, indeed, are more justified in getting what they ask than
we? For we pray for your authority, asking that you may, as is most just, continue the royal succession, son from father, and receive such increase and extension of your realm that all men will eventually be your subjects. This is to our interest too, “so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life,”<a class="Note" id="fna_x.iii.iii-p164.1" href="#fnf_x.iii.iii-p164.1"><sup class="Note">959</sup></a> and be ready to do all we are commanded.</p>

        <i>Selections from the Work Against Heresies by Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons: “The Refutation and Overthrow of the Knowledge Falsely So Called”</i>
      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <h3 id="xi.i.i-p0.1">INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <h4 id="xi.i.i-p0.2">The General Character of His Work</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p1"><span class="sc">Irenaeus of lyons occupies a paradoxical</span> position in the modern study of the Fathers of the Church. Since his great work was first published by Erasmus in
1526, no Christian writer of the age before Augustine has been so frequently called to enter directly into our modern controversies. The result is that his ideas are discussed as ideas and not simply as historical relics of early Christian teaching. This is partly due to his significant, though not wholly clear, references to topics of Church order and New Testament history, and his statements about the authority of Scripture and tradition, matters that have been of current interest ever since the
sixteenth century. His evidence for the Eucharistic devotion and liturgical practice of his time is so valuable, and yet so tantalizing, that an eighteenth century scholar was led to amplify this source of information by publishing a few fragments of Irenaeus which he seems to have constructed himself.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p1.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p1.2"><sup class="Note">960</sup></a> Yet all these are matters rather incidental in Irenaeus’ discussion, introduced as buttresses to his main argument. His main purpose in writing is to establish in clear simplicity the belief in one God which Christianity inherited from Judaism,
and the faith in the redemption of the human race through Jesus Christ his only Son. These constitute the specifically Christian gospel, whether in the twentieth century or in the second. It is not surprising that modern theologians invite Irenaeus to give them his support in our modern discussions. One of the works that has been a turning point of modern

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_344"/>  <strong>{Page 344}</strong> theology calls for a return to the “classic doctrine” of the atonement which he expounded.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p1.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p1.3"><sup class="Note">961</sup></a> Again, a recent writer looks to him for a sound statement of the structure of revelation.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p1.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p1.4"><sup class="Note">962</sup></a> It is not unnatural that all claim him for their own—a Swedish bishop finds his teaching in harmony with that of Luther,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p1.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p1.5"><sup class="Note">963</sup></a> a French Church historian speaks of him as a truly Catholic soul,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p1.6" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p1.6"><sup class="Note">964</sup></a> and an English editor modestly observes that one could easily find in his writings all the articles of the Church of England.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p1.7" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p1.7"><sup class="Note">965</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p2">Yet when the student first turns from modern citations of Irenaeus to the actual writings of the bishop of Lyons he is likely to be puzzled and even repelled. Weird systems of fantastic speculation, almost as difficult to understand as to sympathize with, are given careful if not favorable exposition. Moreover, they are refuted by arguments which, when they get beyond general principles, seem often to be based on eccentric interpretations of the Bible, or on attempts at reasoning in which rhetoric is stronger than logic. The profound insights which commentators have found in Irenaeus appear as islands of brilliance in a work which pursues its turgid way,
following a general outline to be sure, but often seeming to lose sight of it when the author descends to details.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p3">The greatness of Irenaeus appears all the more clearly when one realizes how fully it was by concentration on the problems of his own day that he made his permanent contribution to Christian thought. The title under which he wrote his great work, The Refutation and Overthrow of the Knowledge Falsely So Called, is both more impressive and a truer reflection of his approach than the prosaic label Five Books Against the Heresies, by which the manuscripts generally describe it. Irenaeus may be considered as the first great systematic theologian of the Church, but he did not write a systematic theology. As his preface indicates, he wrote as a pastor and teacher of the Church, and addressed himself to other pastors to assist them in protecting their flocks from teachings that seriously perverted the gospel or replaced it by a jumble of speculations and encouraged either laxity of conduct or serious misbehavior.

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_345"/>  <strong>{Page 345}</strong> The systems that we call Gnostic have this in common, that
they found orthodox Christianity, with its straightforward
creed, too simple. (Our use of the term “Gnostic” is not
exactly Irenaeus’, since he seems to use it for the earlier
phases of the movement, although it is not clear precisely
to what systems he limited it.) They professed at least to
give a more complex answer to the riddle of the universe.
It might be in terms of a vague world of divine beings, the
Fullness or <i>Plērōma</i> of deity, the least and feeblest of whom
had, as a result of some fatal error, departed from the bright
world above and brought into being this physical universe,
from which the goal of true wisdom is to escape. Or it might
be in terms of dualism, explaining the ambiguities of mortal
existence by telling of the conflict of two independent powers,
good and evil, or perhaps merely perfect and imperfect. The
first of these answers produces the system of Valentinus, the
second that of Marcion, and most of the rest may be classified
as variations of one or the other. Marcion is of all the leading
Gnostics the one who is most definitely a heretic, that is, the
leader of a divergent movement within the Christian tradition
itself. He is indeed the first founder of a denomination or sect
among Christians; in various parts of the Near East Marcionite
Churches confronted Catholic for some centuries. In spite of
his rejection of the Old Testament, his teaching had a strong
Puritan note. His followers became one of the sects, of which
the Manichaeans were the most lasting, in which the ascetic
was considered to be the only real Christian and the ordinary
believer, who had not wholly broken with the world and its
affairs, was either denied baptism or treated as little more than
a catechumen. Gnostics of the Valentinian type, on the other
hand, are scarcely to be listed as Christians, although the names
of Jesus Christ, the Father, the Spirit, and other Christian or
Jewish terms might be the most concrete elements in otherwise
shadowy systems of speculation. They were more likely to be
concerned with the difference between matter and spirit than
with that between good and evil—or, if they were trichotomists,
with a distinction between the physical, the psychic, and the
spiritual. Only the higher order mattered, and hence the body
was perhaps to be abused, or perhaps to be indulged—in any
case it was not to be redeemed. Hence one could not believe
that even a lesser deity had really entered into human nature.
Christ was perhaps a high power (how much higher, different
teachers would express differently) who came upon Jesus at

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_346"/>  <strong>{Page 346}</strong> his baptism and left him before his death, thus avoiding the double scandal of the birth from a woman and the death on the cross. Their closest approach to the idea of God present in the man Christ Jesus would be in such words as these:</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p4">“The invisible Christ was incorporeal, whereas Jesus was a corporeal or bodily existence. The dual personality, of the seen and the unseen, the spiritual and material, the Christ and Jesus, continued until the Master’s ascension, when the human, the corporeal concept, or Jesus, disappeared, while his invisible self, or Christ, continued to exist in the eternal order of Divine Science,”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p4.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p4.1"><sup class="Note">966</sup></a> though this quotation is from a modern writer.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p5">To Irenaeus the refutation of Gnosticism was primarily a practical and pastoral matter. The background of his writings is the rivalry between sound religion and the vagaries of the esoteric and the occult for the souls of men and also of women.
The latter are represented by the good ladies of Irenaeus’ own congregation on the banks of the Rhone, who were attracted by the impressive if meaningless ceremonies of a Gnostic conventicle, in which when grace was called down upon the
water it visibly turned pink—by some chemical trick, as Irenaeus was sure.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p5.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p5.1"><sup class="Note">967</sup></a> Gnostics could not really believe in the incarnation. Therefore they could not really believe in the extension of divine power into human life by sacraments celebrated within this physical order. Least of all could they hope in the resurrection, which proclaimed that the eternal promise of life with God belonged to the body as well as to the soul. In replying to them Irenaeus develops in some detail the interrelation of incarnation, Eucharist, and resurrection. His general line of thought, if not any particular phrase, seems to be the justification for the sentiment which English writers since the seventeenth century have ascribed rather vaguely to the Fathers, that the sacraments are the extension of the incarnation.</p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.i-p5.2">The Life  of Irenaeus</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p6">Only a few episodes from the life of Irenaeus are recorded. He first appears as the bearer of a letter from the confessors of Lyons to the church of Rome at the time of the persecution of <span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="xi.i.i-p6.1"/>A.D.</span> 177. He was then already a respected leader of the

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_347"/>  <strong>{Page 347}</strong> Church, holding the office of presbyter.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p6.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p6.2"><sup class="Note">968</sup></a> He himself tells us
that he had personal memories of the great Polycarp, the
“blessed and apostolic presbyter” who for many years headed
the church of Smyrna. As quoted by Eusebius from a lost letter,
they seem more like the memories of a bright boy, vividly
recalling the scenes of his childhood, than of a pupil of a theologian. He could remember where Polycarp used to sit and
stand, what he looked like, and what he used to say in his sermons.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p6.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p6.3"><sup class="Note">969</sup></a> Polycarp could say at his martyrdom in 155 that he
had served the Lord for six-and-eighty years; his reminiscences
of John and others who had seen the Lord made him for Irenaeus an invaluable link in tradition, since thus only two
stages separated him from the days of Jesus. Whether family,
personal, or missionary motives led to his going to Rome and
then to Lyons we cannot say. He was probably at Rome when
Polycarp visited the city in the time of Bishop Anicetus, shortly
before his death, although Irenaeus’ references to that visit
do not stress his personal knowledge.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p6.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p6.4"><sup class="Note">970</sup></a> He derives enough of
both ideas and phrases from Justin Martyr to make it probable
that he had been a pupil of Justin’s as well as a reader of his
books, though his own interests are considerably different.
When he wrote the Refutation and Overthrow he had probably
long since left the capital, except for the visit of 177. But it
was still for him the natural center of the Christian as of the
civilized world. The heresies that he attacked were primarily
those that had either sprung from, or spread to, the imperial
city, although he improved his information about them by
personal inquiries at Lyons.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p7">Second century Lyons was a lesser Rome. A commercial
city at the head of navigation on the Rhone, center of the
Roman road system for Gaul, it was the seat of a garrison, and the
capital of one of the Gallic provinces. Through the <i><span><a id="xi.i.i-p7.1"/>concilium
Galliarum</span></i> it was the headquarters of the imperial cult for three
provinces, and a metropolis in its own right as well as a gateway
between the Mediterranean world and the provinces north
of the Alps. Like Rome, it had a large Greek-speaking element
in its population, and among this element Christianity was
first established. The martyrs of Lyons included several of
Asiatic origin, and the account of their martyrdom notes as

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_348"/>  <strong>{Page 348}</strong> exceptional that the deacon Sanctus of the nearby town of
Vienne confessed his faith in Latin, answering to all questions only

<i><span><a id="xi.i.i-p7.2"/>Christianus sum.</span></i><a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p7.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p7.3"><sup class="Note">971</sup></a> Irenaeus felt a human homesickness at
times for the Greek cities of his youth. He registers a real sorrow
as well as making a formal rhetorical apology, when he notes
that he is an exile among the Celts, accustomed to speaking a
barbarous tongue. By this I am not at all sure that he does not
mean Latin, although local Celtic dialects are also in view.
His later contacts with the rest of the Christian world are by
letter. In spite of his love for personal tradition, he learned
about earlier days largely from the same literary sources that
are known to us.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p8">On return from his visit to Rome, Irenaeus succeeded the
martyr Pothinus as bishop at Lyons, and Eusebius speaks of
him as leader of Christians in Gaul. Certainly his interest,
perhaps also his missionary responsibility, extended to such
congregations as existed in northern parts of Gaul and in Germany (that is, in the Roman provinces along the Rhine).
In the Refutation and Overthrow, Irenaeus continues the list
of Roman bishops down to Eleutherus, who was succeeded
by Victor about 189 or 190. He thus dates approximately the
composition of that work. His other preserved work, The
Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching, refers to the Refutation and is therefore later. Irenaeus last appears in history when
he addresses a respectful but firm letter of protest to Pope
Victor for his threatened excommunication of the Asiatic
churches on account of their loyalty to the observance of the
paschal feast on the Jewish date, the fourteenth of Nisan, instead of the following Sunday. Eusebius takes leave of him with
the note that he was indeed a promoter of the peace of the
Church, as his name suggested, both in this and in his other
letters on the subject.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p8.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p8.1"><sup class="Note">972</sup></a> Having been more than an infant when
he knew Polycarp, Irenaeus was probably over sixty by the
end of the second century. He would scarcely have been silent
in the controversies that arose after the death of Victor
(<span style="font-size:smaller"><a id="xi.i.i-p8.2"/>A.D.</span> 198), and probably passed away himself at about the same
time. No authentic tradition credits him with a martyr’s death,
although a general sense of the fitness of things led to his
inclusion as bishop and martyr in medieval martyrologies,
and he is so honored in the calendar of saints today. He was
certainly a martyr in the broader sense, a steadfast witness
for the truth of the gospel.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_349"/>  <strong>{Page 349}</strong> 
      <h4 id="xi.i.i-p8.3">Irenaeus’ Work  and Thought</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p9">In general the Refutation and Overthrow follows a logical
order, although it is not always clear in detail. Book I describes
the heresies in question, sometimes sarcastically, and Book II
shows their absurdity. In Book III the basis of Christian doctrine
in Scripture and tradition is laid down, and its essential points,
the unity of God and redemption through Christ, are enlarged
on in detail. Book IV defends against Marcion the unity of
the two covenants, and Book V resumes the discussion of redemption and passes on to the last things and the hope of the
world to come. The Demonstration, which seems to represent
Irenaeus’ teaching to catechumens, follows the order of the
baptismal formula, adducing Scripture proof for belief in
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It avoids the literal millenarianism of the Refutation, which suggests that Irenaeus had either
changed his views on the subject or thought best to pass over
the matter more lightly.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p9.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p9.1"><sup class="Note">973</sup></a> Eusebius mentions several other
works now lost, but they seem to be smaller essays on topics
discussed in the Refutation and Overthrow.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p10">Irenaeus was profoundly a churchman and a pastor, and
he writes as such. He was not desirous of originality, and had
no more hesitation than the Biblical writers in reproducing
material derived from different sources. From this there perhaps
derive the slightly confusing shift in numbering the list of
bishops at Rome, in which the apostles are sometimes counted
and sometimes not, and some repetition with variations in his
treatment of particular heresies. The latter is doubtless due
to notes taken from different sources, and does not simplify
the already complex problem of what Gnosticism really was.
One important source is certainly the work of Justin Martyr
on the history of heresies, whether the collection of material
on that subject referred to in Justin’s First Apology should be
thought of as a published Work or as a collection of notes available for people like Irenaeus who were interested in the subject.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p10.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p10.1"><sup class="Note">974</sup></a> The formal prominence of Simon Magus as the father
of Gnosticism is certainly due to Justin, whose interest in
another native of Samaria was further stimulated by what he
took to be a statue of the heresiarch on the banks of the Tiber.
The systems with which Irenaeus was actively concerned were
the Valentinian, with its variations, and the Marcionite. On

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_350"/>  <strong>{Page 350}</strong> these he doubtless collected information from a number of
sources, supplementing it by some personal contacts with such
representatives of the sects as had come to Lyons and were
causing confusion in his own congregation. A recent study has
shown Irenaeus’ use of works of Theophilus of Antioch, and
also some of the blocks of Eastern Christian tradition which he
employed.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p10.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p10.2"><sup class="Note">975</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p11">But though Irenaeus was dependent on a variety of sources,
it is a great mistake to think of him merely as a compiler.
Even on that level we have to ask why he compiled precisely
this collection of facts and arguments. He did not aim at
originality, but this did not prevent his achieving a considerable
amount of it. He was, to be sure, a man of tradition,
<i>paradosis</i>. To him, however, what was handed down was not a collection
of formal beliefs, but a means of living contact with the sources
of life, indeed with the Life himself. He felt to the full what a
modern writer has called “the thrill of tradition.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p11.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p11.1"><sup class="Note">976</sup></a> His highest aim was to state clearly what the Church believed and
taught, and to preserve that teaching from corruption. Indeed
in his various statements of faith there appear all the essentials
of the Creed of Nicaea except its technical terms. Yet in his
repeated outlines and comments he presented the essence of
Christian theology. Preaching to Gentiles, he was conscious
that the firm belief in one God, Creator of all things, from which
Jews began their introduction to Christianity, needed to be
stressed with others. His view of mankind is neither unduly
dark nor merely optimistic. God has led man through history
to his final revelation, especially by the Law and the Prophets,
whose standing it was necessary to defend against the Marcionite rejection of them. But on the other hand much of that history
is the record of the great rebellion of angels and men, the
apostasy, which God finally countered by the incarnation of
his only Son.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p11.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p11.2"><sup class="Note">977</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p12">Irenaeus’ view of redemption is rich, and indeed may have
gained something from his dealing with Gnostic thought.
Vague as was the basis of Gnostic mythology, it certainly
described the moral and metaphysical structure of the universe

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_351"/>  <strong>{Page 351}</strong> in dramatic terms. Irenaeus sticks to the simplicity of the faith,
but gives it some of the thrill that enables one to describe the
Creed as an epic and the dogma as the drama. The Son of
God worsted the ancient enemy in fair fight, thus redeeming
mankind from its slavery. (It is most unfair to read into the
one word “redeemed” the idea of a ransom paid to the devil.)<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p12.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p12.1"><sup class="Note">978</sup></a> We were bought with a great price; but it was the price of the
victor’s toils endured that we might be free, not a price paid
by omnipotence to any lesser power. In Christ there is a new
creation, a new source of higher life, overcoming the defects
of the basically good yet weakened first creation. There is a
new Adam and also, as Irenaeus observes in passing, a new Eve,
since the obedience of Mary began to repair the damage done
by the disobedience of the mother of all living. Is this a piece
of unwritten apostolic tradition, as has been suggested,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p12.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p12.5"><sup class="Note">979</sup></a> or was Irenaeus here stimulated by Gnostic ideas about the mother
to start a chain of speculation on the dignity of the mother of
Christ, which was later to have remarkable developments?
In any case, the new life is primarily life in Christ, of whom
Irenaeus anticipates an Alexandrian epigram when he says
that he became what we are so that we might become what he is.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p12.7" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p12.7"><sup class="Note">980</sup></a> This new life is a life of faith, which certainly for Irenaeus
means the acceptance of sound belief, but in the sense of joyful
turning to God, not simply of correct information about him.
In the circle of the new life God’s world, created good, returns
once more to its right relation to him. In contrast to all Gnostic
or falsely spiritual depreciation of the material universe,
Irenaeus stresses the significance of the offerings of bread and
wine which the Church, as the priest of creation, offers to God.
They are the gifts of thanksgiving which become the body
and blood of Christ, and as such preserve our bodies and souls
to everlasting life.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p12.8" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p12.8"><sup class="Note">981</sup></a> God redeems nature by nature and through
nature. We can best understand Irenaeus’ tendency to even
a literal eschatology of the earthly millennium as part of his
insistence that God has redeemed his own dear universe and
not simply provided a way of escape from it. And so at the end
of the drama the world which came from God will visibly
return to him again.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_352"/>  <strong>{Page 352}</strong> 
      <p id="xi.i.i-p13">Irenaeus did not want to speculate, but he could not help
it. He was a practical theologian and not a formal philosopher.
After all, he was a missionary and pastor in Lyons, and did
not move in the sophisticated circles to which some of the
Apologists tried to commend the gospel. But he provided the
framework of formal theology and indicated the topics that
later theology and Christian philosophy would have to take
up. How the Son of God and the Spirit are related to the
Father he never discusses, but he lays down the terms of that
discussion by treating both as in the sphere of deity, while
writing on the precise subject of Christian monotheism. That
question was to come up immediately, in fact, was already
the subject of controversy at Rome before the death of Irenaeus.
On other topics, like the atonement and sacraments, he threw
out hints that were not to be taken up for some time. His
credal assertions, however, about God and his world waited for
philosophical development only for the next Christian who was
also a philosopher—in other words, for the bright boy who was
already reading books at Alexandria when the old bishop
finished his task at Lyons. Irenaeus closes the first age of the
formulation of tradition, and opens the way for Origen, who
is his logical successor in the general movement of Christian
thought.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p14">The great interest of the study of Irenaeus’ sources for his
knowledge of Christian truth is that they are also ours. In other
words, he is the first Christian writer who worked with the New Testament much as we do. It is for him as for us part
of the Bible, although he does not put it exactly that way.
He reveres the Old Testament and vigorously asserts its
authority for Christians; but the Apostolic Writings can be
quoted for themselves, and Irenaeus does not have to attempt,
like Justin or the Apostolic Fathers, to base the gospel on the
Old Testament if he is to use arguments from a sacred book.
He refers to all the New Testament books except two or three
of the shortest epistles,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p14.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p14.3"><sup class="Note">982</sup></a> although the authority of the Writings
is still that of each of its parts taken separately rather than of
the collection as a whole. Tradition brought him the creed and
the rites of the Church; but it was not, except perhaps for one
or two minor items, a great source of further information. On
the whole he was dependent on the books available to him at
Lyons, including already venerated works of the early Fathers,

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_353"/>  <strong>{Page 353}</strong> like I Clement and the Shepherd of Hermas, which are admirable Writings too, though not on the level of the apostolic compositions. In writing about the New Testament Scriptures and interpreting them, Irenaeus is an exegete and even a
higher critic. He collects external and internal evidence for the authorship and character of the Gospels. His essays in exegesis are sometimes startling, as when he argues that Jesus had a long ministry of two decades, since otherwise there would be no point in the phrase, “You are not yet fifty years old.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p14.9" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p14.9"><sup class="Note">983</sup></a> As an interpreter of the Christian tradition, Irenaeus had about the same resources that were available to later Patristic scholars.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p15">Irenaeus could already look back to an early Church and even to a middle period, the age of men like Polycarp who connected his generation with that of the apostles. Through them he could almost join hands with Jesus himself, and in
effect say to his Gallic converts, “What our eyes have seen . . . and our hands have handled of the Word of life.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.i-p15.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.i-p15.3"><sup class="Note">984</sup></a> Life in Christ is ever new and directly received, but its connection with the historic Jesus is already dependent on links; hence the importance of a sound succession in the Church. This must be taken in no narrow sense. Irenaeus finds it in the traditions of elders, and points it out in the series of directors in a great Church like the Roman (so we might translate <i>episkopos</i>, since the term had not yet become primarily a technical one by translation). But the great succession which Irenaeus stresses is the succession of faith and life from generation to generation of believers, bound together in the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.i-p15.6">The Latin Translation  of Irenaeus</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p16">Irenaeus has suffered the strange fate that none of his works are preserved complete in the language in which they were written. This is partly because he wrote so definitely for the problems of his own age, partly because the hints he offered
for Greek theology were so completely taken up by later writers as to make reference to him superfluous. Doubtless also local situations contributed. Lyons was the natural center of interest in Irenaeus, and the Greek tradition in the church there did
not long survive him. Eusebius still knew Irenaeus in Greek; like many modern students, he was mainly interested in the

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.i-Page_354"/>  <strong>{Page 354}</strong> incidental historical evidence that he preserves. Treatises on
heresies rapidly became a form of Christian antiquarianism.
This kind of interest is responsible for the preservation of much
of Book I by the fourth century heresiologist, Epiphanius of
Salamis, who lifted into his collection Irenaeus’ account of Valentinus and other Gnostics. Hippolytus of Rome had already
made use of him, and there are a few later quotations.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.i-p17">Happily a Latin translation of the Refutation and Overthrow
was produced, probably not very long after Irenaeus’ time,
and as further fragments of the Greek are identified they can
be checked into their proper place in it. Where the original
is available, the translation seems to be almost woodenly
literal, and on the whole the student of Irenaeus is grateful
for this, since it gives him reasonable confidence in depending
on the general sense of the translation elsewhere. A point on
which the translator gives us comfort rather than help is the
question of those Gnostic terms that are also Greek words. Are
they to be treated as personal names or personifications, and so
in English should it be Bythos or Depth, Sophia or Wisdom,
Monogenes or Only-begotten, and so on? The Latin translator
evidently felt that they were sometimes one and sometimes the
other, and used his discretion as to whether to translate or
transliterate, not always consistently; the English translator
seems justified in following his example without always being
bound by his authority. The first printed edition was edited by Erasmus in 1526, and ever since then the study of Irenaeus has
been pursued with vigor. Seventeenth century scholars identified two families among the Latin manuscripts; critical editions
begin with the eighteenth. W. W. Harvey’s edition of 1857
prints a full collection of Greek fragments along with the Latin,
and is adequate for most practical purposes. More recently
an Armenian version has come to light (Books 4 and 5 and
fragments) and will have to be employed in any future critical
edition. It is also to an Armenian version that we owe the
modern recovery of the Demonstration.</p>

      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p4.2">Preface</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p5"><b>1</b> Certain men, rejecting the truth, are introducing among us false stories and vain genealogies, which serve rather to controversies, as the apostle said,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p5.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p5.1"><sup class="Note">985</sup></a> than to God’s work of building up in the faith. By their craftily constructed rhetoric they lead astray the minds of the inexperienced, and take them captive,
corrupting the oracles of the Lord, and being evil expounders of what was well spoken. For they upset many, leading them away by the pretense of knowledge from Him who constituted and ordered the universe, as if they had something higher and greater to show them than the God who made the heaven and the earth and all that is in them. By skillful language they artfully attract the simple-minded into their kind of inquiry, and then crudely destroy them by working up their blasphemous and impious view about the Demiurge. Nor can their simple hearers distinguish the lie from the truth.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p6"><b>2</b> For their error is not displayed as what it is, lest it should be
stripped naked and shown up; it is craftily decked out in an attractive dress, and made to seem truer than the truth itself to the inexperienced because of the outer appearance. As one better than I am has said about these matters, a precious stone
like emerald, which many value greatly, can be put to shame by a clever imitation in glass, unless there is someone on hand who can test it, and show what was done deceptively by art; and when brass is mixed with silver, what untrained person
can easily prove it? So then, lest some should be made prey of through my fault, like sheep by wolves, not recognizing them because of their outwardly wearing sheep’s clothing—whom
the Lord warned us to guard against<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p6.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p6.1"><sup class="Note">986</sup></a> —and because they

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_359"/>  <strong>{Page 359}</strong> talk like us, though thinking very differently, I thought it necessary, my dear friend, after reading the Commentaries, as they call them, of the disciples of Valentinus, and having met some of them and so become familiar with their point of view, to expound to you those portentous and profound mysteries, which not all accept, since not all have sufficiently purged their brains.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p6.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p6.5"><sup class="Note">987</sup></a> Then you, being informed about these things, may be able to make them clear to all your people, and to warn them to be on their guard against this abysmal folly and blasphemy against Christ. As well as I can, then, I will briefly and clearly describe the position of the present false teachers, I mean the followers of Ptolemaeus, who is an offshoot of the school of Valentinus. I will further provide, as far as my modest ability extends, the means of overthrowing it, showing how absurd and foreign to the truth are the things they say. I am neither practiced in writing nor trained in rhetoric, but my love for you and yours encourages me to bear my witness about these teachings which have been hidden till the present, but have now by the grace of God come to light. “For there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed, nor secret, that shall not be made known.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p6.8" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p6.8"><sup class="Note">988</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p7"><b>3</b> You will not expect from me, a resident among the Celts, and mostly accustomed to a barbarous language, rhetorical skill, which I have never learned, nor power in writing, which I have not acquired, nor beauties of language and style, which
I am not acquainted with.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p7.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p7.2"><sup class="Note">989</sup></a> But what I write to you out of love, plainly and truly and simply, you will surely receive in love, and you can then amplify for yourself, having greater ability than mine, what I have given you, as it were, in basic principles. With your breadth of mind you will be able to make much more fruitful what I have said to you in brief, and will be able to present powerfully to your people what I have feebly expounded to you. As I have endeavored, in response to your long-held desire to know their position, not only to
make it plain to you, but also to give you the necessary means of showing its falsity, so do you perform a similar service for the rest, according to the grace which the Lord has given you, so that men may no longer be ensnared by their plausibilities,
which are as follows.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_360"/>  <strong>{Page 360}</strong> 
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p7.3">The Faith of the Church</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p8"><b>10</b> Now the Church, although scattered over the whole civilized world to the end of the earth, received from the apostles and their disciples its faith in one God, the Father Almighty, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the seas, and all
that is in them, and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who was made flesh for our salvation, and in the Holy Spirit, who through the prophets proclaimed the dispensations of God—the comings, the birth of a virgin, the suffering, the resurrection
from the dead, and the bodily reception into the heavens of the beloved, Christ Jesus our Lord, and his coming from the heavens in the glory of the Father to restore all things, and to raise up all flesh, that is, the whole human race, so that every
knee may bow, of things in heaven and on earth and under the earth, to Christ Jesus our Lord and God and Saviour and King, according to the pleasure of the invisible Father, and every tongue may confess him,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p8.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p8.1"><sup class="Note">990</sup></a> and that he may execute righteous judgment on all. The spiritual powers of wickedness, and the angels who transgressed and fell into apostasy, and the
godless and wicked and lawless and blasphemers among men he will send into the eternal fire. But to the righteous and holy, and those who have kept his commandments and have remained in his love, some from the beginning [of life] and some since their repentance, he will by his grace give life incorrupt, and will clothe them with eternal glory.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p9"><sup>2</sup>Having received this preaching and this faith, as I have said,
the Church, although scattered in the whole world, carefully preserves it, as if living in one house. She believes these things [everywhere] alike, as if she had but one heart and one soul, and preaches them harmoniously, teaches them, and hands them down, as if she had but one mouth. For the languages of the world are different, but the meaning of the [Christian] tradition is one and the same. Neither do the churches that have been established in Germany believe otherwise, or hand down any other tradition, nor those among the Iberians, nor those among the Celts, nor in Egypt, nor in Libya, nor those established in the middle parts of the world. But as God’s creature, the sun, is one and the same in the whole world, so also the preaching of the truth shines everywhere, and illumines all men who wish to come to the knowledge of

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_361"/>  <strong>{Page 361}</strong> the truth. Neither will one of those who preside in the churches who is very powerful in speech say anything different from these things, for no one is above [his] teacher,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p9.6" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p9.6"><sup class="Note">991</sup></a> nor will one who is weak in speech diminish the tradition. For since the
faith is one and the same, he who can say much about it does not add to it, nor does he who can say little diminish it.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p10"><sup>3</sup>This matter of having more or less understanding does not mean that men change the basic idea, and imagine another God above the Demiurge and Maker and Nourisher of this universe, as if he were not enough for us, or another Christ or another Only-begotten. But it consists in working out the things that have been said in parables, and building them into the foundation of the faith: in expounding the activity and dispensation of God for the sake of mankind; in showing clearly how God was long-suffering over the apostasy of the angels who transgressed, and over the disobedience of men; in declaring why one and the same God made some things subject to time, others eternal, some heavenly, and some earthly; in understanding why God, being invisible, appeared to the prophets, not in one form, but differently to different ones; in showing why there were a number of covenants with mankind, and in teaching what is the character of each of the covenants; in searching out why God shut up all in disobedience that he might have mercy on all; in giving thanks that the Word of God was made flesh, and suffered; in declaring why the coming of the Son of God [was] at the last times, that is, the
Beginning was made manifest at the end; in unfolding what is found in the prophets about the end and the things to come; in not being silent that God has made the despaired-of Gentiles fellow heirs and of the same body and partners with the saints;
and in stating how this mortal and fleshly [body] will put on immortality, and this corruptible incorruption; and in proclaiming how he says, “What was not a people, is a people, and what was not beloved, is beloved,” and, “Many more are
the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p10.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p10.2"><sup class="Note">992</sup></a> With reference to these things and others like them the apostle
exclaimed, “O depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge
of God; how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past
finding out!”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p10.9" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p10.9"><sup class="Note">993</sup></a> But [this greater skill] does not consist in imagining beyond the Creator and Demiurge the Mother of these

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_362"/>  <strong>{Page 362}</strong> things and of him, the Desire of a wandering Aeon, and coming to such a point of blasphemy, nor in falsely conceiving of the Pleroma above her, now with thirty, now with an innumerable crowd of Aeons, as these teachers who are indeed void of divine
understanding say. But as I said before, the real Church has one and the same faith everywhere in the world.</p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p10.13">Valentinus</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p11"><b>11</b> Let us now look at the inconsistent views of these men, since there are two or three of them anyway, how they do not even agree on the same topics, but vary from each other both about things and about names. The first of these, Valentinus, who adapted the principles of the so-called Gnostic heresy to the
individual character of his school, thus expounded it, defining that there is an unnamable Dyad, of which one is called Ineffable and the other Silence. Then from this Dyad a second Dyad was produced, of which he calls one part Father and the
other Truth. From the Tetrad were produced Logos and Zoë, Anthropos and Ecclesia,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p11.13" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p11.13"><sup class="Note">994</sup></a> and this is the first Ogdoad. From Logos and Zoë he says that ten Powers were produced, as I said before, but from Anthropos and Ecclesia twelve, one of which, falling away and suffering a lack, brought about the rest of the business. He postulated two Boundaries, one between the depth and the rest of the Pleroma, dividing the begotten Aeons from the unbegotten Father, and the other separating
their Mother from the Pleroma. Christ was not produced from the Aeons within the Pleroma, but was conceived by the Mother who was outside, according to her knowledge of better things, but with a kind of shadow. He, being male, cast off the shadow from himself and returned into the Pleroma. Then the Mother, being left with the shadow, and emptied of spiritual substance, brought forth another Son, and this is the Demiurge, whom he also calls almighty over things subject to him. He
taught that there was also produced with him a left-hand Ruler, as do those falsely called Gnostics whom we shall speak of. He sometimes says that Jesus was produced by him who was separated from their Mother and reunited with the
others, that is, the Desired; sometimes from him who returned to the Pleroma, that is, from Christ; sometimes from Anthropos and Ecclesia. And he says that the Holy Spirit was produced by the Truth to inspect and fructify the Aeons, entering into

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_363"/>  <strong>{Page 363}</strong> them invisibly, through whom the Aeons produced the plants of truth.</p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p11.21">Secundus</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p12"><sup>2</sup>Secundus<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p12.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p12.2"><sup class="Note">995</sup></a> says that there is a first Ogdoad, a right-hand and a left-hand Tetrad, as he would have them called, one light, the other darkness; and the Power that fell away and
suffered lack was not begotten of the thirty Aeons, but of their fruits.
 <sup>3</sup>There is another distinguished teacher among them, who, striving after something more sublime, and an even greater knowledge, speaks thus of the first Tetrad: There is a certain Proarche before all things, beyond any thought or
speech or name, whom I call Monotes; with this Monotes is another Power, whom I call Henotes.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p12.8" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p12.8"><sup class="Note">996</sup></a> This Henotes, and this Monotes, being the One, sent forth, but not as causing an emanation, the intelligible Arche over all things, which Arche is known in speech as Monad. With this Monad there also reigns a Power of one substance with him, which I also call the One. These powers, Monotes and Henotes, Monad and the
One, sent forth the other productions of the Aeons.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p13"><sup>4</sup><i>Iu</i>, <i>iu</i>, and <i>pheu</i>, <i>pheu</i>! Truly we may utter these exclamations from tragedy at such bold invention of ridiculous nomenclature, and at the audacity that made up these names without blushing. For when he says, “There is a certain Proarche before all things, above all thought, which I call Monotes,” and again, “With this Monotes there reigns a Power, which I call Henotes,” it is obvious that he admits that he is talking about his own inventions, and that he has given names to his inventions which no one else had given them before. It is clear also that he himself dared to make up these names, and unless he had been on hand the Truth would have had no name. There is no reason why someone else shouldn’t assign names like these on the same basis: There is a royal Proarche above all thought, a Power above all substance, indefinitely extended. Since this is the Power which I call the Gourd, there is with it the Power which
I call Superemptiness. This Gourd and Superemptiness, being one, emitted, yet did not emit, the fruit, visible, edible, and delicious, which is known to language as the Cucumber. With this Cucumber there is a Power of like quality with it, which

      <p id="xi.i.iii-p14"><sup>5</sup>Others again have called their first and self-begotten Ogdoad by these names—first Proarche, then Inconceivable, the third Ineffable, and the fourth Invisible; and from the first Proarche proceeded in the first place [of the second Tetrad], and fifth [of the whole] Arche, from Inconceivable in the second and sixth place Incomprehensible, from Ineffable in the third and seventh place Unnamable, and from Invisible in the fourth and eighth place Unbegotten, the Pleroma of the first Ogdoad. They would have these Powers anterior to Depth and Silence, so that they may appear as more perfect than the perfect and more knowing than the
Gnostics—to whom one might
properly say, “What babbling sophists!” And even about Depth there are many different opinions among them. Some make him out to be unmated, being indeed neither male nor female—in fact, not being anything. Others say that he is both male and female, assigning him the nature of a hermaphrodite. Others again assign him Silence as a consort, that there may be the first conjunction.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p15"><b>21</b> Their [i.e., the
Marcosian] tradition about redemption<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p15.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p15.2"><sup class="Note">998</sup></a> is obscure and incomprehensible, as being the mother of things that cannot be grasped or clearly seen. Because it is fluctuating, it cannot be described simply or in one account, as each one of them hands it down as he chooses. Each of these mystagogues has his own ceremony of redemption. That this pattern has been instigated by Satan to lead them to renounce the baptism of rebirth to God, indeed to deny the whole faith, I

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_365"/>  <strong>{Page 365}</strong> will show in the proper place when I refute them.
 <sup>2</sup>They say that it is necessary for those who have received perfect knowledge to be reborn into the power which is above all things—otherwise one cannot enter the Pleroma, since this is what leads them
to the Depth. The baptism of Jesus who appeared [on earth]
was [they say] for remission of sins, but the redemption of the Christ who came down upon him, for perfection, and they allege that the former is animal, the latter spiritual. Baptism was preached by John for repentance, but redemption was added by Jesus for perfection; and it is with reference to this
that he says, “I have another baptism to be baptized with,
and I press on eagerly towards it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p15.13" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p15.13"><sup class="Note">999</sup></a> So they also say that the Lord propounded this redemption to the sons of Zebedee,
when their mother asked that they might sit on his right and left in the Kingdom, and he said, “Can you be baptized with
the baptism that I am to be baptized with?”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p15.15" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p15.15"><sup class="Note">1000</sup></a> Paul too, they claim, often testifies of the redemption in Christ Jesus, and this
is [the rite] which they hand down in diverse and discordant forms.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p16"><sup>3</sup>For some of them prepare a nuptial couch and perform a sacred rite for those who are “perfected,” with certain invocations, saying that they have performed a spiritual marriage, according to the likeness of the conjunctions above. Some bring [the candidates] to the water, and baptize them with these
words: “In the Name of the unknowable Father of all things—in Truth the mother of all—in him who came down upon Jesus—into union and redemption and the fellowship of the Powers.” Others invoke certain Hebrew names, in order to
impress the initiates even more, thus,
<i>“Basema chamosse baaiabora mistadia ruada kousta babophor calachthei.”</i><a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p16.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p16.2"><sup class="Note">1001</sup></a> The interpretation of these is as follows: “Above every Power of the Father I
invoke the light which is named, and the good Spirit and Life, for you have reigned in the body.” Others use this invocation for redemption: “The name which is hidden from all godhead, and lordship, and truth, which Jesus of Nazareth put on in the
regions of the light of Christ, of Christ who lives by the Holy Spirit, for angelic redemption—the name of restoration, <i>Messia ouphareg namempsaiman chaldaian mosomedaea acphranai psaoua</i>,

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_366"/>  <strong>{Page 366}</strong> <i>Jesus Nazaria</i>.” The interpretation of these is as follows: “I
do not divide the Spirit of Christ, the heart, and the supercelestial
power, the merciful; may I name your name, O Saviour of
Truth.” This is what those who initiate invoke, while he who
is initiated replies, “I am strengthened and redeemed, and I
redeem my soul from this age, and from all things connected
with it in the name of Iao, who redeemed his soul to full
redemption in the living Christ.” Then those present respond,
“Peace to all on whom this name rests.” Then they anoint the
initiate with balsam, for they say that this ointment is a type
of the sweetness which is above all things.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p17"><sup>4</sup>Some of them say that it is superfluous to lead men to the
water, but mixing oil and water together, with utterances like
those which I have quoted, they pour it on the head of those
being initiated; and this they make out to be the redemption. They also anoint them with balsam. Others omit all these
things, and say that the mystery of the ineffable and invisible
should not be performed by means of visible and corruptible
things, and [that of] the inconceivable and incorporeal, by sensible and bodily; but the perfect redemption is the knowledge of the ineffable Greatness itself. For weakness and suffering were brought about by ignorance, and everything that has
come from ignorance is destroyed by knowledge, and knowledge is the redemption of the inner man. This is not bodily, since the body is corruptible; nor is it psychic, since the soul came from deficiency, and is as it were a mere dwelling place of the spirit—therefore redemption must be spiritual. So the inner spiritual man is redeemed by knowledge, and they need nothing more than the knowledge of all things—and this is true redemption.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p18"><sup>5</sup>There are others who keep on “redeeming” the dying up
to the moment of death, pouring oil and water on their heads,
or the ointment mentioned above mixed with water, and with
the invocations mentioned above, that they may not be grasped
or seen by the principalities and powers, and that their inner
man may ascend even above the invisible things, while their
body is left among the things of the world and the soul abandoned to the Demiurge.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p18.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p18.2"><sup class="Note">1002</sup></a> And they tell them to say this when they come to the Powers after they have died: “I am the son of the Father, the Father who pre-existed, a son in the pre-existent; I came to see both alien things, and my own, yet they

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_367"/>  <strong>{Page 367}</strong> are not wholly alien, but belong to Achamoth, who is female,
and made them for herself; for I derive my race from the pre-existent, and I go again to my own, from which I came forth.”
And they claim that he who says this will avoid and escape the
powers; he will come to those who surround the Demiurge,
and say to them: “I am a precious vessel, more than the female
being who made you. Though your mother does not know her
origin, I know myself, and I know whence I am, and I call
on the incorrupt Wisdom, who is in the Father, who is the
Mother of your mother, and has no Father nor any male
consort; for a female, made of a female, made you, not knowing
her own Mother, and thinking that she was alone; but I call
upon her Mother.” When they hear this, those who surround the Demiurge will be greatly troubled, and revile their origin, and the race of their Mother; but he will go to his own, casting
off his chain, that is, the [animal] soul. This is what has come to
me about the redemption. Since their teachings and traditions
are different, and the newer ones among them claim to be
constantly finding something new, and working out what no
one ever thought of before, it is hard to describe their views.</p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p18.9">Cerdon and Marcion</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p19"><b>27</b> Cerdon, who took his start from the followers of Simon, and settled at Rome under Hyginus, who held the ninth place in
the episcopal succession from the apostles,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p19.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p19.5"><sup class="Note">1003</sup></a> taught that the God preached by the Law and the Prophets was not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the former was known and the latter unknown, the former righteous and the latter good.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p20"><sup>2</sup>After him came Marcion of Pontus, who developed his
teaching, shamelessly blaspheming the God whom the Law
and the Prophets proclaimed, describing him as the author of
evils, desirous of wars, changing his opinions, and [at different
times] contrary to himself. But Jesus [was] from the Father who
is above the God that formed the world, and came into Judea in the time of Pontius Pilate, who was procurator of Tiberius Caesar; manifest in human form to those who were in Judea,
he abolished the Prophets and the Law, and all the works
of that God who made the world, whom he calls the World
Ruler.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p20.7" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p20.7"><sup class="Note">1004</sup></a> In addition to this he mutilated the Gospel According to
Luke, removing everything about the birth of the Lord,

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_368"/>  <strong>{Page 368}</strong> and much of the teaching of the words of the Lord, in which
the Lord is recorded as clearly confessing the creator of this
universe as his Father. He persuaded his disciples that he was
more veracious than the apostles who handed down the gospel,
giving them not a gospel but a mere fragment of a gospel. He
also similarly cut up the Epistles of Paul, removing whatever
the apostle said clearly about the God who made the world,
that he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and whatever the
apostle teaches by referring to the prophetic writings that
predict the coming of the Lord.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p21"><sup>3</sup>Only the souls [he says] of those who have learned his teaching will come to salvation; the body, since it is taken from the
earth, cannot be saved. To his blasphemy against God he adds
this, speaking diabolically indeed and in direct opposition to
the truth: that Cain and those like him—the men of Sodom and the Egyptians, and other such, and in general all the
nations that walked in all kinds of wickedness—were saved
by the Lord when he descended into the lower regions, and
came running to him and received him into their realm;
but Abel and Enoch and Noah and the other righteous, and
the patriarchs such as Abraham, with all the prophets and those
who were pleasing to God, did not share in the salvation which
the serpent who was in Marcion preached. For, he says, since
they knew that their God was always testing them, they thought
he was testing them then, and so did not come to Jesus or believe
his proclamation, and therefore their souls remained in Hades.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p22"><sup>4</sup>But since this man alone has dared publicly to mutilate the
Scriptures, and more than any others to malign God shamelessly, I will refute him separately, convicting him from his
own writings, and from the words of the Lord and the apostles
which he preserves and uses I will overthrow him, with the
help of the Lord.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p22.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p22.1"><sup class="Note">1005</sup></a> But here it is necessary only to mention
him, that you may know that all those who corrupt the truth
and injure the teaching of the Church are the disciples and
successors of Simon Magus the Samaritan. Although, in order
to deceive others, they do not confess the name of their teacher,
yet they teach his views. Setting up the name of Christ Jesus
as a kind of decoy, but in one way or another introducing the
impiety of Simon, they bring many to destruction, spreading
their evil teachings under a good name, and by the sweetness
and beauty of the name [of Christ] offering them the bitter
and evil poison of the serpent, the prince of the apostasy.</p>

      <h3 id="xi.i.iii-p22.3">THE TEXT: (BOOK III) THE FAITH IN SCRIPTURE AND TRADITION</h3>
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p22.4">Preface</h4>
      <p class="Continue" id="xi.i.iii-p23">It was your command, my dear friend, that I should bring
out into the open the teachings of the Valentinians, which
they consider to be hidden, showing their diversity, and
developing an argument against them. So I undertook to
exhibit the succession of their teachings, maintaining that they
derive from
Simon the father of all heretics, and to reply to
them all. Since it is in many respects part of one work to explain
and to refute them, I have sent you these books, of which the
first contains the opinions of all of them, and shows their
habits and the nature of their behavior. In the second their
evil teachings are destroyed and overthrown, and shown up
nakedly for what they are. Now in this third book I introduce
the arguments from the Scriptures, thus leaving out nothing
that you asked for. Indeed, I will have given you, beyond what
you had expected, the means of reasoning with and refuting
those who offer any kind of evil teaching. For the love which
is in God, being rich and ungrudging, gives more than one asks
from it. Keep in mind therefore what I have said in the two
previous books; and by adding this to them you will have
from me a full reply against all heretics, and will be able to
resist them faithfully and boldly on behalf of the one true and
life-giving faith, which the Church has received from the
apostles and imparts to her children. For the Lord of all gave
to his apostles the power of the gospel, and by them we
also have learned the truth, that is, the teaching of the Son
of God—as the Lord said to them, “He who hears you hears
me, and he who despises you despises me, and him who sent
me.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p23.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p23.3"><sup class="Note">1006</sup></a></p>
      <span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_370"/>  <strong>{Page 370}</strong> 
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p23.5">The Traditions of the Gospels</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p24"><b>1</b> For we learned the plan of our salvation from no others than
from those through whom the gospel came to us. They first
preached it abroad, and then later by the will of God handed
it down to us in Writings,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p24.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p24.1"><sup class="Note">1007</sup></a> to be the foundation and pillar of
our faith. For it is not right to say that they preached before
they had come to perfect knowledge, as some dare to say,
boasting that they are the correctors of the apostles. For after
our Lord had risen from the dead, and they were clothed with
the power from on high when the Holy Spirit came upon them,
they were filled with all things and had perfect knowledge.
They went out to the ends of the earth, preaching the good
things that come to us from God, and proclaiming peace from
heaven to men, all and each of them equally being in possession
of the gospel of God. So Matthew among the Hebrews issued
a Writing of the gospel in their own tongue, while Peter and Paul were preaching the gospel at Rome and founding the
Church. After their decease Mark, the disciple and interpreter
of Peter, also handed down to us in writing what Peter had
preached. Then Luke, the follower of Paul, recorded in a book
the gospel as it was preached by him. Finally John, the disciple
of the Lord, who had also lain on his breast, himself published
the Gospel, while he was residing at Ephesus in Asia.
 <sup>2</sup>All of these handed down to us that there is one God, maker of
heaven and earth, proclaimed by the Law and the Prophets,
and one Christ the Son of God. If anyone does not agree with
them he despises the companions of the Lord, he despises
Christ the Lord himself, he even despises the Father, and he is
self-condemned, resisting and refusing his own salvation, as
all the heretics do.</p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p24.11">The Apostolic Tradition</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p25"><b>2</b> But when they are refuted from the Writings they turn
around and attack the Writings themselves, saying that they are
not correct, or authoritative, and that the truth cannot be
found from them by those who are not acquainted with the
tradition. For this [they say] was not handed down in writing,
but orally, which is why Paul said, “We speak wisdom among

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_371"/>  <strong>{Page 371}</strong> the perfect, but not the wisdom of this world.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p25.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p25.2"><sup class="Note">1008</sup></a> Each of them
utters a wisdom which he has made up, or rather a fiction, so
that according to them the truth was once to be found in
Valentinus, then at another time in Marcion, at another
time in Cerinthus, then later in Basilides, or was also in that
opponent, who has no saving message to utter.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p25.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p25.4"><sup class="Note">1009</sup></a> Each one of
them is wholly perverse, and is not ashamed to preach himself,
corrupting the rule of faith.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p26"><sup>2</sup>But when we appeal again to that tradition which has come
down from the apostles and is guarded by the successions of
elders<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p26.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p26.1"><sup class="Note">1010</sup></a> in the churches, they oppose the tradition, saying
that they are wiser not only than the elders, but even than the
apostles, and have found the genuine truth. For the apostles
[they say] mixed matters of the Law with the words of the
Saviour, and not only the apostles, but even the Lord himself,
spoke sometimes from the Demiurge, sometimes from the middle
power, sometimes from the highest, while they know the
hidden mystery without doubt or corruption, and in its purity.
This is in nothing less than shameless blasphemy against their
Maker. What it comes to is that they will not agree with either
Scripture or tradition.  <sup>3</sup>It is such people, my dear friend, that
we have to fight with, who like slippery snakes are always trying
to escape us. Therefore we must resist them on all sides, hoping
that by cutting off their escape we may be able to bring them
to turn to the truth. For although it is not easy for a soul
which has been seized by error to turn back, still it is not
absolutely impossible to put error to flight by putting the truth
beside it.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p26.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p26.2"><sup class="Note">1011</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p27"><b>3</b> The tradition of the apostles, made clear in all the world,
can be clearly seen in every church by those who wish to behold
the truth. We can enumerate those who were established by
the apostles as bishops in the churches, and their successors
down to our time, none of whom taught or thought of anything
like their mad ideas. Even if the apostles had known of hidden
mysteries, which they taught to the perfect secretly and apart

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_372"/>  <strong>{Page 372}</strong> from others, they would have landed them down especially
to those to whom they were entrusting the churches themselves.
For they certainly wished those whom they were leaving as
their successors, handing over to them their own teaching
position, to be perfect and irreproachable, since their sound
conduct would be a great benefit [to the Church], and failure
on their part the greatest calamity.  <sup>2</sup>But since it would be
very long in such a volume as this to enumerate the successions
of all the churches, I can by pointing out the tradition which
that very great, oldest, and well-known Church, founded and
established at Rome by those two most glorious apostles Peter
and Paul, received from the apostles, and its faith known among
men, which comes down to us through the successions of
bishops, put to shame all of those who in any way, either
through wicked self-conceit, or through vainglory, or through
blind and evil opinion, gather as they should not.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p27.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p27.1"><sup class="Note">1012</sup></a> For every
church must be in harmony with this Church because of its
outstanding pre-eminence, that is, the faithful from everywhere, since the apostolic tradition is preserved in it by those
from everywhere.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p27.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p27.4"><sup class="Note">1013</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p28"><sup>3</sup>When the blessed apostles had founded and built up the
Church, they handed over the ministry of the episcopate to
Linus. Paul mentions this Linus in his Epistles to Timothy.
Anencletus succeeded him. After him Clement received the
lot of the episcopate in the third place from the apostles: He

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_373"/>  <strong>{Page 373}</strong> had seen the apostles and associated with them, and still
had their preaching sounding in his ears and their tradition before
his eyes—and not he alone, for there were many still left
in his time who had been taught by the apostles. In this Clement’s
time no small discord arose among the brethren in Corinth,
and the Church in Rome sent a very powerful letter to the
Corinthians, leading them to peace, renewing their faith, and
declaring the tradition which they had recently received from
the apostles, which declared one almighty God, maker of
heaven and earth and fashioner of man, who brought about
the Deluge, and called Abraham; who brought out the people
from the land of Egypt; who spoke with Moses; who ordained
the Law and sent the Prophets; and who has prepared fire for
the devil and his angels. Those who care to can learn from this
Writing that he was proclaimed by the churches as the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and so understand the apostolic
tradition of the Church, since this Epistle is older than those
present false teachers who make up lies about another God
above the Demiurge and maker of all these things that are.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p28.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p28.1"><sup class="Note">1014</sup></a> Evarestus succeeded to this Clement, and Alexander to Evarestus; then Xystus was installed as the sixth from the apostles,
and after him Telesphorus, who met a glorious martyrdom;<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p28.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p28.2"><sup class="Note">1015</sup></a> then Hyginus, then Pius, and after him Anicetus. Soter followed
Anicetus, and Eleutherus now in the twelfth place from the
apostles holds the lot of the episcopate. In this very order and
succession the apostolic tradition in the Church and the preaching of the truth has come down even to us. This is a full demonstration that it is one and the same life-giving faith which had
been preserved in the Church from the apostles to the present,
and is handed on in truth.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p29"><sup>4</sup>Similarly Polycarp, who not only was taught by apostles,
and associated with many who had seen Christ, but was installed by apostles for Asia, as bishop in the church in Smyrna—I
saw him myself in my early youth—survived for a long
time, and departed this life in a ripe old age by a glorious
and magnificent martyrdom. He always taught what he learned
from the apostles, which the Church continues to hand on, and

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_374"/>  <strong>{Page 374}</strong> which are the only truths. The churches in Asia all bear
witness to this, as do those who have succeeded Polycarp
down to the present time; he is certainly a much more
trustworthy and dependable witness than Valentinus and Marcion
and the other false thinkers. When he visited Rome under
Anicetus, he converted many of the above-mentioned heretics
to the Church of God, proclaiming that he had received from
the apostles the one and only truth, the same which is handed
on by the Church. There are those who have heard him tell
how when John the disciple of the Lord went to bathe at
Ephesus, and saw Cerinthus inside, he rushed out of the bath
without washing, but crying out, “Let us escape, lest the bath
should fall while Cerinthus the enemy of the truth is in it.”
Polycarp himself, when Marcion once met him and said,
“Do you know us?” answered, “I know you, the first-born of
Satan.” The apostles and their disciples took such great care
not even to engage in conversations with the corrupters of the
truth, as Paul also said, “A heretical man after a first and second
warning avoid, knowing that such a man has fallen away and
is a sinner, being self-condemned.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p29.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p29.1"><sup class="Note">1016</sup></a> There is also a very
powerful letter of Polycarp addressed to the Philippians, from
which those who care to, and are concerned for their own
salvation, can learn the character of his faith and [his]
preaching of the truth. The church in Ephesus also, which was
founded by Paul, and where John survived until the time of
Trajan, is a true witness of the tradition of the apostles.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p30"><b>4</b> Since there are so many clear testimonies, we should not seek
from others for the truth which can easily be received from the
Church. There the apostles, like a rich man making a deposit;
fully bestowed upon her all that belongs to the truth, so that
whoever wishes may receive from her the water of life. She is
the entrance to life; all the others are thieves and robbers.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p30.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p30.1"><sup class="Note">1017</sup></a> Therefore we ought to avoid them, but to love with the greatest
zeal the things of the Church, and so to lay hold of the tradition
of the truth. What if there should be a dispute about some
matter of moderate importance? Should we not turn to the
oldest churches, where the apostles themselves were known,
and find out from them the clear and certain answer to the
problem now being raised? Even if the apostles had not left
their Writings to us, ought we not to follow the rule of the
tradition which they handed down to those to whom they
committed the churches?  <sup>2</sup>Many barbarian peoples who believe

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_375"/>  <strong>{Page 375}</strong> in Christ follow this rule, having [the message of their] salvation
written in their hearts by the Spirit without paper and ink.
Diligently following the old tradition, they believe in one God,
maker of heaven and earth and of all that is in them, through
Christ Jesus the Son of God, who on account of his abundant
love for his creation submitted to be born of a virgin, himself
by himself uniting man to God, and having suffered under
Pontius Pilate, and risen, and having been received up into
splendor, is to come in glory as the Saviour of those who are
saved, and the judge of those who are judged, and will send
into eternal fire those who alter the truth, and despise his
Father and his coming. Those who believe in this faith without
written documents are barbarians in our speech, but in their
convictions, habits, and behavior they are, because of their
faith, most wise, and are pleasing to God, living in all righteousness and purity and wisdom. If anyone should preach to them
the inventions of the heretics, speaking in their own language,
they would at once stop their ears and run far, far away, not
enduring even to listen to such blasphemous speech. So by that
old tradition of the apostles they do not even take into their
minds whatever their impressive words may mean.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p31">Nor do they have any proper congregation or established
teaching.  <sup>3</sup>For there were no Valentinians before Valentinus, or
Marcionites before Marcion; nor were there any of these
perverse thinkers whom I have listed above before the founders
and inventors of their perversity. For Valentinus came to
Rome under Hyginus; he flourished under Pius and remained
until [the time of] Anicetus. Cerdon, who was Marcion’s
predecessor, used to come into the Church under Hyginus
and make his confession,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p31.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p31.1"><sup class="Note">1018</sup></a> reaching the point where he
would now give his secret teaching, now make his confession
in public, and then was convicted of his evil teachings and was
separated from the assembly of the brethren. Marcion, who
followed him, flourished under Anicetus, who held the tenth
place in the series of bishops. As we have shown, the others
who are called Gnostics began with Menander, the disciple of
Simon, and each has as his father and chief the one whose
opinions he followed. All of these rebelled in their apostasy
much later [than the founding of the Church], in the midst of
the Church’s history.</p>
      <span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_376"/>  <strong>{Page 376}</strong> 
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p32"><b>5</b> So the apostolic tradition is preserved in the Church and has
come down to us. Let us turn, then, to the demonstration from
the Writings of those apostles who recorded the gospel, in which
they recorded their conviction about God, showing that our
Lord Jesus Christ is the Truth, and in him is no lie—as also
David said when he prophesied his birth of a virgin and the
resurrection of the dead, “Truth has come forth from the
earth.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p32.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p32.1"><sup class="Note">1019</sup></a> The apostles, being disciples of the truth, are apart
from every lie. For a lie has no fellowship with the truth, any
more than light with darkness, but the presence of one excludes
the other.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p32.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p32.3"><sup class="Note">1020</sup></a> So our Lord, being the Truth, did not lie, and he
would never have confessed one whom he knew to be the result
of a defect as God and God of all, supreme King and his Father,
the perfect [acknowledging] the imperfect, a spiritual being
one who was natural, one who was in the Pleroma one outside
it. Nor did his disciples name any other being as God, or call
any other Lord, except him who is the true God and Lord of
all—though it be said by these vainest of sophists that the
apostles hypocritically adjusted their teaching to the capacity
of their hearers, giving answers according to the presumptions
of inquirers, telling blind fables to the blind according to their
blindness, to the sick according to their sickness, and to those
who were going astray according to their error, and to those
who thought that the Demiurge was the only God declaring
that this was the case, but to those who can understand the
ineffable Father expounding the unspeakable mystery by
parables and riddles. So [they allege] the Lord and the apostles
did not exercise their teaching office in strict accordance with
the truth, but hypocritically in accordance with what different individuals could grasp.  <sup>2</sup>This is not the behavior of those
who heal and give life, but rather of those who aggravate
disease and increase ignorance. The Law shows itself much
truer than such people, when it says that whoever leads a
blind man astray in the way is accursed.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p32.6" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p32.6"><sup class="Note">1021</sup></a> The apostles were
sent to find those who were lost, and to bring sight to those who
did not see, and healing to the sick, and so they did not speak
to them in accordance with their previous opinions but by

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_377"/>  <strong>{Page 377}</strong> manifestation of the truth. For no men of any kind would be
acting rightly if they told blind men who were already
beginning to fall over the precipice to continue in their very
dangerous way, as if it were a sound one and as if they would
come through all right. What doctor, when wishing to cure a
sick man, would act in accordance with the desires of the
patient, and not in accordance with the requirements of medicine? The Lord himself testified that he came as the physician
of the sick, saying, “The well have no need of a physician but
the sick; I came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p32.8" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p32.8"><sup class="Note">1022</sup></a> How, then, are the sick to be made strong? and how
are sinners to repent? Is it by persevering as they are? or on
the contrary, by undergoing a great change and reversal of
their previous behavior, by which they brought upon themselves serious illness, and many sins? Ignorance, the mother
of these things, is driven out by knowing the truth. Therefore the Lord imparted knowledge of the truth to his
disciples, by which he cured those who were suffering, and
restrained sinners from sin. So he did not speak to them in
accordance with their previous ideas, nor answer in accordance with the presumptions of inquirers, but in accordance
with the sound teaching, without any pretense or respect for
persons.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p33"><sup>3</sup>This can be shown by the words of the Lord. He displayed
the Son of God to those of the circumcision, the Christ who was
predicted by the prophets—that is, he showed himself, who
restored freedom to men and gave them the heritage of incorruption. Then the apostles taught the Gentiles that they
should leave the vain sticks and stones which they thought of
as gods, and worship the true God, who had established and
made the whole human race, and by his ordinance nourished,
increased, and preserved them, and gave them their being; and
that they should look for his Son Jesus Christ—who redeemed
us from the apostasy by his blood, that we also might be made
a holy people—who is to come down from heaven in the
power of the Father, and who is to execute judgment upon all,
and give the good things that come from God to those who have
kept his commandments. He appeared in these last times and
gathered and united into one those who were far off and those
who were near, enlarging Japheth and establishing him
in the dwelling of Shem.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p33.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p33.1"><sup class="Note">1023</sup></a></p>
      <span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_378"/>  <strong>{Page 378}</strong> 
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p34"><b>11</b> John, the disciple of the Lord, proclaimed this faith and
wished by the proclamation of the gospel to destroy the error
which had been planted among men by Cerinthus, and much
earlier by those who are called Nicolaitans, who are an offshoot
of the knowledge which is falsely so called, [writing] to confound
them and show that there is one God who made all things by
his Word. It is not true, as they say, that the Fashioner is one
and the Father of the Lord another, and the Son of the Fashioner one being, the Christ from on high another, who remained free from suffering, descending on Jesus the Son of the
Fashioner and returning again to his Pleroma; [they allege]
that the Beginning was the Only-begotten, and Logos the
true Son of the Only-begotten,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p34.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p34.1"><sup class="Note">1024</sup></a> and that this world order in
which we live was not made by the supreme God but by some
power far inferior to him and cut off from contact with those
things which are invisible and ineffable.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p35">The disciple of the Lord wished to cut off all such ideas and
to establish the rule of truth in the Church, that there is one
God Almighty who made all things by his Word, both visible
and invisible, and also to indicate that through the same Word
through whom God made this world order he also bestowed
salvation on the men who belong to this order. So he starts off
with the teaching according to the Gospel, thus: “In the
beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the
Word was God; this was in the beginning with God. All things
were made through him, and without him nothing was made.
What was made was life in him, and the life was the light of
men, and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness
has not seized hold of it.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p35.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p35.1"><sup class="Note">1025</sup></a> All things, he says, were made
through him; this word “all” therefore includes this world
order of ours. It must not be conceded to them that “all”
means what is within that Pleroma of theirs. For if this Pleroma
of theirs contains everything, then this order is not outside it,
as I have shown in the Book before this. But if these things are
outside the Pleroma, which really does not seem possible, then
this Pleroma of theirs does not comprise “all things,” and so
[in any case] this vast created order is not merely “outside.”

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_379"/>  <strong>{Page 379}</strong>  <sup>2</sup>John himself indeed takes away all our disputes on this matter
when he says: “He was in this world, and the world was made
by him, and the world knew him not. He came to his own
[things and his own [peopled did not receive him.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p35.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p35.3"><sup class="Note">1026</sup></a> Now
according to Marcion and those who are like him, neither was
the world made by him, nor did he come to his own things, but
rather to alien. According to some of the Gnostics, this world
was made by angels and not through the Word of God. According to the followers of Valentinus again, it was not made
through him, but through the Demiurge. For he, as they say,
made certain images in imitation of the things above, but the
Demiurge carried out the forming of the creation. For they say
that the Lord and Demiurge of this created order of things,
by whom they say this world was made, was sent forth by the
Mother—when the Gospel clearly states that all things were
made through the Word, who was in the beginning with God,
which Word, he says, was made flesh and dwelt among us.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p36"><sup>3</sup>Now according to them neither was the Word made flesh,
nor Christ, nor the Saviour who was made out of all [the
Aeons]. For they allege that the Word and Christ never came
into this world, and that the Saviour was neither incarnate nor
suffered, but that he descended as a dove upon that Jesus
who was made by [higher] dispensation, and when he had
proclaimed the unknown Father, ascended again into the
Pleroma. Some of them indeed say that this Jesus who was by
dispensation was incarnate and suffered, and that he had passed
through Mary like water through a tube; others say that it
was the son of the Demiurge, on whom the Jesus who was by
dispensation descended; others again say that Jesus indeed
was born of Joseph and Mary, and that Christ who came from
above descended on him, being without flesh and free from
suffering. But according to none of the views of the heretics
was the Word of God made flesh. If one should read over all,
their credal statements, he would find that they always bring
in the Word of God and the Christ who is from above as without
flesh and free from suffering. Some think that he was manifested as a transfigured man, but say that he was neither born
nor incarnate. Others say that he did not even take the form of
a man, but descended like a dove on that Jesus who was
born of Mary. So the disciple of the Lord shows them all to be
false witnesses when he says, “And the Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us.”  <sup>4</sup>And so that we should not query what

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_380"/>  <strong>{Page 380}</strong> God it was whose Word was made flesh, he further taught,
saying, “There was a man sent from God, his name was
John; he came for witness, to bear witness of the light. He was
not himself the light, but [came] that he might bear witness
of the light.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p36.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p36.1"><sup class="Note">1027</sup></a> What God was it who sent John the Forerunner, who bore witness of the light? He whose angel Gabriel
is, who brought the good news of his birth, he who also promised through the prophets that he would send his angel before
the face of his Son, and that he would prepare his way, that is,
would bear witness of the light, in the spirit and power of
Elijah.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p36.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p36.3"><sup class="Note">1028</sup></a> And whose servant and prophet was Elijah? His who
made the heaven and the earth, as he also confessed. So how
could John, who was sent by the Creator and Fashioner of
this world, testify of that light which descended from things
that are unnamable and invisible? For all the heretics have
taught that the Demiurge was ignorant of the power above
him, as witness and pointer-out of whom John appeared.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p36.6" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p36.6"><sup class="Note">1029</sup></a> Because of this, the Lord said that he ranked as more than a
prophet. For all the other prophets proclaimed the coming of
the Father’s light, and longed to be worthy to see him whom
they foretold; John, however, both predicted him like the
others, and also saw and pointed him out when he came, and
persuaded many to believe in him, so that he ranks as both
prophet and apostle.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p36.7" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p36.7"><sup class="Note">1030</sup></a> This is something more than a prophet
—first apostles, then prophets<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p36.11" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p36.11"><sup class="Note">1031</sup></a>—;but all came from one and
the same God.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p37"><sup>5</sup>It was a good thing which was made by God’s creation in the
vineyard, and was first drunk as wine.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p37.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p37.1"><sup class="Note">1032</sup></a> None of those who
drank of it spoke badly of it, and the Lord also took some of it.
But better wine was that which was made by the Word directly
and simply out of water for the use of those who were invited
to the wedding. Although the Lord could have provided wine
for the feasters and satisfied the hungry with food without
using any object of the created order, he did not do so; but
taking loaves which came from the earth, and giving thanks,
and again making water into wine, he satisfied those who lay

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_381"/>  <strong>{Page 381}</strong> down to eat, and he gave drink to those who were invited to
the wedding.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p37.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p37.2"><sup class="Note">1033</sup></a> Thus he showed that God who made the earth;
and commanded it to bring forth fruit, and established the
waters, and brought forth the springs, also in these last times
through his Son gives to the human race the blessing of food
and the favor of drink, the incomprehensible [acting] through
the comprehensible and the invisible through the visible, since
there is none beyond him, but he is in the bosom of the Father.
 <sup>6</sup>For, he says, no man ever saw God, unless the only-begotten
Son of God, who is in the bosom of the Father, himself declared
him. For the Father who is invisible is declared to all by his
Son who is in his bosom. Because of this he is known by those
to whom the Son has revealed him, and again the Father
through the Son gives knowledge of his Son to those who love
him.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p37.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p37.5"><sup class="Note">1034</sup></a> So Nathaniel learned from him and knew him, to whom
the Lord bore witness, “This is a true Israelite, in whom
is no
guile.” The Israelite knew his King, in that he said to him,
“Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p37.9" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p37.9"><sup class="Note">1035</sup></a> Peter was taught by him and knew the Christ, the Son of the
Living God, who said: “Behold my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased; I will put my Spirit upon him and he will
proclaim judgment to the nations. He will not strive, nor shout;
nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; he will not break
the shaking reed, and will not extinguish the smoking flax;
until he send forth judgment into strife, and the nations will
hope in his name.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p37.11" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p37.11"><sup class="Note">1036</sup></a></p>
      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p37.14">The Unity and Number of the Gospels</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p38"><sup>7</sup>These, then, are the principles of the gospel. They declare
one God, the maker of this universe, who was proclaimed by
the Prophets, and who through Moses established the dispensation of the Law, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and besides
him they know no other God, nor any other Father. So firmly
established is this position in the Gospels that the heretics
themselves bear witness to them, and starting from them each
one of them tries to establish his teaching. So the Ebionites;
who use only the Gospel According to Matthew, are shown
by that very document not to have right views about the Lord.

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_382"/>  <strong>{Page 382}</strong> Marcion cut up that According to Luke, yet is clearly, by the
passages which he still keeps, shown to be a blasphemer of the
one existing God. Those who separate Jesus from Christ and
say that Christ remained impassible while Jesus suffered, and
try to bring forward the Gospel According to Mark, can be
corrected out of that, if they will read it with a love of the truth.
The followers of Valentinus, who make a great use of that
According to John to demonstrate their conjunctions, can be
demonstrated from that to be wholly mistaken, as I have
demonstrated in the first Book. Since [even] our opponents
bear witness to us and make use of these [works, our demonstration based on them is firm and true.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p39"><sup>8</sup>The Gospels could not possibly be either more or less in
number than they are. Since there are four zones of the world
in which we live, and four principal winds, while the Church
is spread over all the earth, and the pillar and foundation of
the Church is the gospel, and the Spirit of life, it fittingly has four
pillars, everywhere breathing out incorruption and revivifying
men. From this it is clear that the Word, the artificer of all
things, he who sits upon the cherubim and sustains all things,
being manifested to men gave us the gospel, fourfold in form
but held together by one Spirit. As David said, when asking
for his coming, “O sitter upon the cherubim, show yourself.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p39.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p39.1"><sup class="Note">1037</sup></a> For the cherubim have four faces, and their faces are images of
the activity of the Son of God. For the first living creature, it
says, was like a lion, signifying his active and princely and royal
character; the second was like an ox, showing his sacrificial
and priestly order; the third had the face of man, indicating
very clearly his coming in human guise; and the fourth was
like a flying eagle, making plain the giving of the Spirit who
broods over the Church. Now the Gospels, in which Christ is
enthroned, are like these.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p39.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p39.3"><sup class="Note">1038</sup></a> For that According to John
expounds his princely and mighty and glorious birth from the
Father, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God,” and, “All things were
made by him, and without him was nothing made.” Therefore
this Gospel is deserving of all confidence, for such indeed is his
person. That According to Luke, as having. a priestly character,
began with the priest Zacharias offering incense to God. For

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_383"/>  <strong>{Page 383}</strong> the fatted calf was already being prepared which was to be
sacrificed for the finding of the younger son.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p39.6" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p39.6"><sup class="Note">1039</sup></a> Matthew proclaims his human birth, saying, “The book of the generation
of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham,” and, “The birth
of Jesus Christ was in this manner,” for this Gospel is manlike,
and so through the whole Gospel [Christ] appears as a man of a
humble mind, and gentle. But Mark takes his beginning from
the prophetic Spirit who comes on men from on high, saying,
“The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in
Isaiah the prophet,” showing a winged image of the gospel.
Therefore he made his message compendious and summary,
for such is the prophetic character. Again, the Word of God
himself used to speak to the patriarchs before Moses, in a divine
and glorious manner; but for those under the Law he established a priestly and liturgical order; after this, becoming man,
he sent out the gift of the Holy Spirit into the whole earth,
guarding us by his own wings. As is the activity of the Son of
God, such is the form of the living creatures; and as is the form
of the living creatures, such is also the character of the Gospel.
For the living creatures were quadriform, and the gospel and
the activity of the Lord is fourfold. Therefore four general
covenants were given to mankind: one was that of Noah’s
deluge, by the bow; the second was Abraham’s, by the sign of
circumcision; the third was the giving of the Law by Moses;
and the fourth is that of the Gospel, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p40"><sup>9</sup>Since this is the case, they are foolish and uninstructed, even
audacious, who destroy the pattern of the gospel, and present
either more or less than four forms of the gospel—the former,
because they claim to have found more than the truth, the
latter because they annul the dispensations of God. So Marcion,
rejecting the whole gospel, rather indeed cutting himself off
from the gospel, still boasts of having a share in the gospel.
Others frustrate the gift of the Spirit, which in these last
times has been poured out on the human race according to the
Father’s decree, refusing to admit that aspect [of the gospel]
which is according to John’s Gospel, in which the Lord promised that he would send the Paraclete; but they reject together
both the gospel and the prophetic Spirit. Unhappy men, who
want to be some kind of false prophets, but deny the gift of
prophecy to the Church, suffering what those do who, because
of those who come in insincerity, separate themselves from the

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_384"/>  <strong>{Page 384}</strong> fellowship of the brethren. It can be understood that men of
this kind would not accept the apostle Paul either. For in the
Epistle addressed to the Corinthians he speaks carefully about
prophetic gifts, and knows of men and women who prophesied
in the Church. Sinning in all these ways against the Spirit of
Gad, they fall into the unforgivable sin.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p40.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p40.1"><sup class="Note">1040</sup></a> But the followers of
Valentines, putting away all fear, bring forward their own
compositions and boast that they have more Gospels than really
exist. Indeed their audacity has gone so far that they entitle
their recent composition the Gospel of Truth, though it agrees
in nothing with the Gospels of the apostles, and so no Gospel
of theirs is free of blasphemy. For if what they produce is the
Gospel of Truth, and is different from those which the apostles
handed down to us, those who care to can learn how it can
be shown from the Scriptures themselves that [then] what is
handed down from the apostles is not the Gospel of Truth.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p40.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p40.5"><sup class="Note">1041</sup></a> That those alone are true and firm, and that there can be no
more Gospels than have been mentioned before, nor any fewer,
I have shown by these many great arguments. For since God
made all things in due order and harmony, it was proper that
the outer form of the gospel should be well ordered and well
fitted together. So having examined the view of those who
handed the gospel down to us, from their very first principles,
let us proceed to the other apostles, and look into their view
about God; and after that let us hear the very words of the
Lord.</p>

      <h4 id="xi.i.iii-p40.7">Doctrine of Redemption in Reply to the Gnostics</h4>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p41"><b>1</b> We could in no other way have learned the things of God unless our Teacher, being the Word, had been made man. For none could declare to us the things of the Father, except his own Word. For who else has known the mind of the Lord, or who has become his counselor?<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p41.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p41.1"><sup class="Note">1042</sup></a> Nor again could we have learned in any other way than by seeing our Teacher, that we might become imitators of his works and doers of his words, and so have communion with him, receiving our increase from him who is perfect and before all creation. We were but recently
made by him who is the highest and best, by him who is able to bestow the gift of incorruptibility, made according to the image which is with him and predestined according to the foreknowledge of the Father to be what we were not yet. Made the beginning of [his new] creation, we have received [this gift] in times foreknown by the dispensation of the Word, who is perfect in all things, for he is the mighty Word, and true man. Redeeming us by his blood in accordance with his reasonable<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p41.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p41.3"><sup class="Note">1043</sup></a> nature, he gave himself a ransom for those who had been led into captivity. Since the apostasy tyrannized over us unjustly, and when we belonged by nature to God Almighty had unnaturally alienated us, God’s Word, mighty in all things, [reclaimed us], making us his own disciples. Not failing in his quality of justice, he acted justly against the apostasy itself, not redeeming his own from it by force, although it at the beginning had merely tyrannized over us, greedily seizing the things that were not its own, but by persuasion, as it is

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_386"/>  <strong>{Page 386}</strong> fitting for God to receive what he wishes by gentleness and not
by force.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p41.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p41.4"><sup class="Note">1044</sup></a> So neither was the standard of what is just infringed
nor did the ancient creation of God perish.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p42">So, then, since the Lord redeemed us by his own blood, and
gave his soul for our souls, and his flesh for our bodies, and
poured out the Spirit of the Father to bring about the union
and communion of God and man—bringing God down to
men by [the working of] the Spirit, and again raising man to
God by his incarnation—and by his coming firmly and truly
giving us incorruption, by our communion with God, all the
teachings of the heretics are destroyed.  <sup>2</sup>Vain are those who say
that his appearance [on earth] was a mere fiction. These things
did not take place fictitiously but in reality. If he had appeared
as man when he was not really human, the Spirit of God could
not have rested on him, as was the case, since the Spirit is
invisible,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p42.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p42.1"><sup class="Note">1045</sup></a> nor would there have been any truth in him, what
was [then taking place] not being what it seemed to be. As I
said before, Abraham and the other prophets saw him prophetically, prophesying by vision what was to be. If he then
had appeared without really being what he appeared to be,
this would have been just another prophetic vision for men,
and they would have had to wait for another coming, in which
he would be indeed what now was seen prophetically. I have
shown too that to say that his appearance was only seeming
is the same as to say that he took nothing from Mary. He would
not have had real flesh and blood, by which he paid the price
[of our salvation], unless he had indeed recapitulated in himself the ancient making of Adam. Vain therefore are the Valentinians who teach this, and so reject the [new] life of the flesh
and scorn what God has made.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p43"><sup>3</sup>Vain also are the Ebionites, who do not accept in their souls
by faith the union of God and man; but remain in the old
leaven of [merely] human birth—not wishing to understand
that the Holy Spirit came upon Mary, and the power of the
Most High overshadowed her, and so what was born [of her]
is holy and the Son of God Most High, the Father of all who
thus brought about his incarnation and displayed the new
birth, so that as we by the former birth were heirs of death, by
this birth we should be heirs of life. They reject the mixture

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_387"/>  <strong>{Page 387}</strong> of the heavenly wine, and wish to be only the water of the world,
not receiving God into their mixture,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p43.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p43.1"><sup class="Note">1046</sup></a> but remaining in that
Adam who was conquered and driven out of paradise. They
do not reflect that as at the beginning of our creation in Adam
the breath of life from God, united with the created substance,
animated man and made him a rational animal, so at the end
the Word of the Father and the Spirit of God, united with the
ancient substance of the creation of Adam, made a living and
perfect man, receiving the perfect Father, so that as in the
animal we were all dead, in the spiritual we are all made alive.
For Adam never escaped those hands of God, to whom the
Father said, “Let us make man after our image and likeness.”
And therefore at the last it was not by the will of the flesh, nor
by the will of a man, but by the decree of the Father that his
hands perfected a living man, so that there might be a [second
Adam after the image and likeness of God.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p43.2" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p43.2"><sup class="Note">1047</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p44"><b>2</b> Vain indeed are they who say that God [the Son] came to
things not his own, as if covetous of things belonging to another,
in order to hand over the man who was made by another to
the God who neither made nor created him, who indeed from
the beginning had nothing to do with the true fashioning of
man.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p44.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p44.1"><sup class="Note">1048</sup></a> For a coming such as they allege, to what was another’s,
would not have been just. Nor would he have truly redeemed
us by his blood if he had not been truly made man, restoring
again to his own creation what was said [of it] in the beginning,
that man was made according to the image and likeness of
God—not snatching by deceit what was another’s, but justly
and graciously claiming what was his own—for with reference
to the apostasy, he justly redeemed us from it by his own blood,
but with reference to us, who have been redeemed, he acted
graciously. For we gave nothing to him first, nor does he desire
anything from us, as if needing it; but we are in need of communion with him. Therefore he graciously poured himself out
that he might gather us together into the bosom of the Father.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p45"><sup>2</sup>Vain above all are they who despise the whole dispensation
of God, and deny the salvation of the flesh and reject its rebirth,
saying that it is not capable of incorruption. For if this [mortal
flesh] is not saved, then neither did the Lord redeem us by his

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_388"/>  <strong>{Page 388}</strong> blood, nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of his
blood, and the bread which we break the communion of his
body. For blood is only to be found in veins and flesh, and the
rest of [physical] human nature, which the Word of God was
indeed made [partaker of, and so] he redeemed us by his
blood. So also his apostle says, “In whom we have redemption
by his blood, and the remission of sins.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p45.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p45.1"><sup class="Note">1049</sup></a> For since we are his members, and are nourished by [his] creation—and he himself gives us this creation, making the sun to rise, and sending the rain as he wills—he declares that the cup, [taken] from the creation, is his own blood, by which he strengthens our blood,
and he has firmly assured us that the bread, [taken] from the
creation, is his own body, by which our bodies grow.  <sup>3</sup>For when the mixed cup and the bread that has been prepared receive the Word of God, and become the Eucharist, the body and blood of Christ,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p45.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p45.3"><sup class="Note">1050</sup></a> and by these our flesh grows and is confirmed, how can they say that flesh cannot receive the free gift of God, which is eternal life, since it is nourished by the body and blood of the Lord, and made a member of him? As the blessed Paul says in the Epistle to the Ephesians, that we are members of his body, of his flesh and his bones.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p45.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p45.4"><sup class="Note">1051</sup></a> He does not say this about a [merely] spiritual and invisible man, for the spirit has neither bones nor flesh, but about [God’s] dispensation
for the real man, [a dispensation] consisting of flesh and nerves and bones, which is nourished by his cup, which is his blood, and grows by the bread which is his body.</p>

And just as the wooden branch of the vine, placed in the earth, bears fruit in
its own time—and as the grain of wheat, falling into the ground and there
dissolved, rises with great increase by the Spirit of God, who sustains all
things, and then by the wisdom of God serves for the use of men, and when it
receives the Word of God becomes the Eucharist, which is the body and blood of
Christ—so also our bodies which are nourished by it, and then fall into the
earth and are dissolved therein, shall rise at the proper time, the Word of God
bestowing on them this rising again, to the glory of God the Father. It is he
who indeed grants to this mortal immortality, and gives

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_389"/>  <strong>{Page 389}</strong> to the corruptible the gracious gift of incorruption, for God’s
power is made perfect in weakness,<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p46.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p46.1"><sup class="Note">1052</sup></a> so that we should not be
puffed up as if we had life from ourselves, and be exalted
against God, developing ungrateful minds. But we learn by
experience that our survival forever comes from his greatness,
not from our nature, so that we may neither ignore the glory
that surrounds God as he is nor be ignorant of our own nature,
but may see what it is that God can do, and what man receives
as a gift [from him], and so may not wander from the true
conception of the reality of things, with reference to both God
and man. May it not be, as I have said, that God allows our
dissolution into the earth for this very purpose, that being
instructed in every way we should for the future be quite
definite about all [these] things, being ignorant neither of God
nor of ourselves?</p>

the battle against our enemy, and crushing him who at the

“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
between your seed and her seed; he will be on the watch for

the apostle says in the Letter to the Galatians, “The law of works
was established until the seed should come to whom the promise was

it was by a woman that he had power over man from the beginning, setting
himself up in opposition to man. Because of this the Lord also declares
 himself to be the Son of Man, so renewing in himself that primal man
from whom the formation [of man] by woman began, that as our race went
down to death by a man who was conquered we might ascend again to life

      <p id="xi.i.iii-p50"><b>32</b> Since the opinions of some have been affected by the discourses of the heretics, and they are ignorant of the dispensations of God, and the mystery of the resurrection of the just
and the Kingdom which is the beginning of incorruption, by
which Kingdom those who are worthy will gradually be accustomed to receive [the fullness of] God, it is necessary to speak
about these things. For the righteous must first rise again at
the appearance of God to receive in this created order, then
made new, the promise of the inheritance which God promised
to the Fathers, and will reign in this order. After this will
come the judgment. It is just that in the same order in which
they labored and were afflicted, and tried by all kinds of suffering, they should receive the fruits of [their suffering]—that in
the same order in which they were put to death for the love of
God they should again be made alive—and that in the same
order in which they suffered bondage they should reign. For
God is rich in all things, and all things are his.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p50.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p50.1"><sup class="Note">1062</sup></a> It is right,
therefore, for this created order to be restored to its pristine

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_392"/>  <strong>{Page 392}</strong> state, and to serve the just without restraint. The apostle
made this clear in the Epistle to the Romans, saying: “For the
expectation of the creature awaits the revelation of the sons
of God. For the creature was subject to vanity, not willingly,
but because of him who subjected it in hope; for the creature
itself shall be freed from the servitude of corruption into the
freedom of the glory of the sons of God.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p50.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p50.3"><sup class="Note">1063</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p51"><sup>2</sup>So, then, God’s promise which he promised to Abraham
remains firm. For he said, “Lift up your eyes, and look from the
place where you now are, to the north and south and east and
west; for all this land which you see I will give to you and to
your seed forever.” And again he says, “Arise and go through
the land in its length and its breadth, for I will give it to you.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p51.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p51.1"><sup class="Note">1064</sup></a> Yet he received no inheritance in it, not even a footprint,
but was always a pilgrim and a stranger in it. And when
Sarah his wife was dead, and the Hittites wanted to give him
freely a place for her burial, he would not accept it, but bought
a tomb, for which he gave four hundred didrachmas of silver,
from Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite.<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p51.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p51.3"><sup class="Note">1065</sup></a> He awaited the
promise of God, and did not wish to seem to accept from men
what God had promised to give him, saying to him again,
“To your seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt
to the great river Euphrates.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p51.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p51.5"><sup class="Note">1066</sup></a> If, then, God promised him
the inheritance of the [promised] land, but in all his sojourning
there he did not receive it, it must be that he will receive it
with his seed, that is, with those who fear God and believe
in him, at the resurrection of the just. For his seed is the Church,
which receives through the Lord adoption to God, as John the
Baptist said, “That God is able from these stones to raise up
sons of Abraham.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p51.7" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p51.7"><sup class="Note">1067</sup></a> The apostle also says in the Epistle to the
Galatians, “But you, brothers, are like Isaac the sons of the
promise.” Again in the same he says clearly that those who have
believed in Christ will receive Christ, the promise of Abraham,
saying, “To Abraham were the promises uttered, and to his
seed; and it does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of
one, And to your seed, which is Christ.” And again he says,
confirming what has been said: “Even as Abraham believed
God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. You know
therefore, that those who are of faith, they are the sons of
Abraham. Now the Scripture, foreseeing that God would
justify the Gentiles by faith, foretold to Abraham, In you will

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_393"/>  <strong>{Page 393}</strong> all nations be blessed. Therefore those who are of faith are
blessed with faithful Abraham.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p51.10" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p51.10"><sup class="Note">1068</sup></a> So, then, those who are of
faith are blessed with faithful Abraham, and they are sons of
Abraham. Now God promised the inheritance of the land to
Abraham and his seed, and neither Abraham nor his seed,
that is, those who are justified by faith, have any inheritance
in it now, but they will receive it at the resurrection of the just.
For God is true and faithful, and therefore he says, “Blessed
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p51.13" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p51.13"><sup class="Note">1069</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p52"><b>33</b> Because of this, when he came to his Passion, that he might
declare to Abraham and those with him the glad tidings of the
opening of the inheritance, after he had given thanks as he
held the cup, and had drunk of it, and given to the disciples,
he said to them: “Drink of this, all of you. For this is my blood
of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission
of sins. For I say to you, that I will not drink of the produce of
this vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new
in the Kingdom of my Father.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p52.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p52.1"><sup class="Note">1070</sup></a> Then he himself will renew
the inheritance of the land, and will re-establish the mystery
of the glory of the sons, as David said, “He who renewed the
face of the earth.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p52.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p52.3"><sup class="Note">1071</sup></a> He promised that he would drink of the
produce of the vine with his disciples, thus showing both the
inheritance of the earth, in which the new produce of the vine
is drunk, and the physical resurrection of his disciples. For the
new flesh that rises again is the same that has received the new
cup. For he cannot be understood as drinking the produce of
the vine when established on high with his own, somewhere
above the heavens, nor again are they who drink it without
flesh, for it belongs to flesh and not to spirit to receive the drink
of the vine.  <sup>2</sup>Because of this the Lord said: “When you give a
dinner, or a supper, do not invite the rich, nor your friends and
neighbors and relations, lest they should invite you in return,
and you receive a reward from them; but invite the lame, the
blind, the beggars, who have nothing with which to reward
you; for you will be rewarded at the resurrection of the just.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p52.5" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p52.5"><sup class="Note">1072</sup></a> And again he says, “Whoever has left fields, or houses, or
parents, or brothers, or sons for my sake, shall receive a

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_394"/>  <strong>{Page 394}</strong> hundredfold in this world, and in the one to come will inherit
eternal life.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p52.7" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p52.7"><sup class="Note">1073</sup></a> Where are the hundredfold rewards in this age,
the dinners offered to the poor, and the suppers for which a
reward is received? These things are [to be] in the times of the
Kingdom, that is, on the seventh day, which is sanctified, in
which God rested from all his works which he made; this is
the true Sabbath of the just, in which they will have no earthly
work to do, but will have a table prepared before them by God,
who will feed them with dainties of all kinds.</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p53"><sup>3</sup>This is also the sense of the blessing of Isaac, with which he
blessed Jacob, his younger son, saying, “Behold the smell of
my son is as the smell of a rich field, which God has blessed.”
The field [here referred to] is the world—and therefore he
added: “God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fertility
of the earth, abundance of grain and of wine. And the nations
will serve you, and princes will worship you, and you will be
Lord over your brother, and the sons of your father will worship
you. He who curses you will be accursed, and he who blesses
you will be blessed.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p53.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p53.1"><sup class="Note">1074</sup></a> If one does not take this as referring to
the destined [times] of the Kingdom, he finds himself in great
contradiction and confusion, as the Jews have found themselves
completely puzzled [in interpreting this passage]. For not only
did the nations not serve Jacob in this life, but he, when he
set forth after this blessing, served his uncle Laban the Syrian
for twenty years. Not only was he not made lord of his brother,
but he himself worshiped Esau his brother, when he came back
from Mesopotamia to his father, and offered many gifts to
him. How did he inherit an abundance of grain and wine who,
because of the famine that took place in the land in which he
dwelt, migrated to Egypt [and became] subject to Pharaoh,
who then reigned in Egypt? So the aforesaid benediction
undoubtedly refers to the times of the Kingdom, when the
just, rising from the dead, will reign, when the created order
will be made new and set free, and will produce an abundance
of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven and of the fertility
of the earth. So the elders remembered, who had seen John
the disciple of the Lord, that they had heard from him how
the Lord taught about those days and said: “The days will
come, in which vines will be produced, each one having a

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_395"/>  <strong>{Page 395}</strong> thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs,
and on each twig ten thousand shoots, and on each shoot ten
thousand clusters, and in each cluster ten thousand grapes, and
each grape when pressed will give twenty-five metretes of wine.
And when one of the saints takes hold of a cluster, another will
cry, ‘I am a better cluster, take me, bless the Lord through me.’
Similarly a grain of wheat will produce ten thousand ears, and
each ear will have ten thousand grains, and each grain [will
yield] ten pounds of clear pure flour; and the other fruits and
seeds and grass will produce in the same proportion, and all
the animals, using the foods which come from the earth, will
be peaceful and harmonious with each other, and perfectly
subject to man.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p53.3" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p53.3"><sup class="Note">1075</sup></a></p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p54"><sup>4</sup>Papias, who was a hearer of John and an associate of Polycarp, a fine old man, bore witness to these things in writing,
in his fourth book, for there were five books that he compiled.
And he went on and said, “These things are credible to believers, and when Judas, the traitor, did not believe, and asked,
`How can such kinds of production be accomplished [even]
by the Lord?,’ the Lord answered, ‘Those who come to these
things will see them.’” Isaiah, prophesying about these times,
said: “And the wolf will feed with the lamb and the leopard
will lie down with the kid, and the calf and bull and lion will
feed together, and a little boy will lead them. The ox and the
bear will feed together, and their young ones will be together,
and the lion will eat straw like the ox. A little child will put his
hand in the den of the asps, and into the nest of the young of
the asps, and they shall do no harm, nor will they be able to
injure anyone in my holy mountain.” And again, summarizing,
he says, “The wolves and sheep will feed together, and the
lion will eat straw like the ox, and the serpent earth like bread;
and they will not injure nor disturb in my holy mountain,
says the Lord.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p54.1" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p54.1"><sup class="Note">1076</sup></a> I am not unaware that some try to refer
these [prophecies] to fierce men of diverse nations, and of
different kinds of behavior, who have believed, and when they
have believed have come to agree with the righteous. But although this be now true of various kinds of men who have come
from different nations to the one conviction of the faith, nevertheless [it will also be true] in the resurrection of the just with
reference to these animals, as it is said, “God is rich over all.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p54.4" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p54.4"><sup class="Note">1077</sup></a> And when the created order is renewed, then the animals

<span class="pb" id="xi.i.iii-Page_396"/>  <strong>{Page 396}</strong> ought to be subject to man, arid return to the food which God gave them at the first, the fruit of the earth, as they were subject and obedient to Adam. Some other time, not now, [will be the occasion] to show how the lion will eat straw. But this is enough to show the size and richness of the fruits [then to be produced]. For if such an animal as the lion feeds on straw, what kind of grain must it be whose very straw is suitable food for lions?</p>
      <p id="xi.i.iii-p55"><b>36</b>  Since men are real, they must have a real existence, not passing away into things which are not, but advancing [to a new stage] among things that are.

Therefore God, foreknowing all things, made this pattern of things temporary, as I showed in the book before this, pointing out as far as I could the reason for the creation of the temporal universe. But when this pattern has passed away, and man is made new, and flourishes in incorruption, so that he can no longer grow old, then there will be new heavens and a new earth. In this new order man will

Finally the Son will yield his work to the Father, as is said by the apostle: “For he must reign, until he shall put all enemies under
his feet; death will be destroyed as the last enemy.” For in the times of the Kingdom the just man then upon earth will already have forgotten how to die. “For when he says, All things will be subject, he clearly excepts him who subjected all things. But when all things are subject to him, then will the Son himself be subject to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.”<a class="Note" id="fna_xi.i.iii-p55.13" href="#fnf_xi.i.iii-p55.13"><sup class="Note">1084</sup></a></p>

the same God the Father is manifest, who formed man, and
promised to the Fathers the inheritance of the earth, who brings

This sentence, preserved only in Latin, deserves to be quoted more because of the many
discussions of it than for its own importance. Eusebius tantalizingly
begins a quotation immediately afterward with what he considered of
real interest in this passage. Irenaeus’ solid reasons for selecting the
Roman Church as his chief sample of the preservation of tradition in all
churches have just been given; he seems here to mix them rather confusingly with the thought that as the city of Rome was a microcosm of the
Empire, so was the Roman Church a microcosm of the Christian world,
and the confluence of Christians there preserved the faith by representing
all local traditions;
convenire

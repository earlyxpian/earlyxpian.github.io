    <h2> Translation by Andrew S. Jacobs </h2>
    <section>
      <p></p>
      <blockquote> This early third-century treatise is among the earliest
        explorations of the Christian end-times focused on the figure of
        Antichrist. The term "Antichrist" first appeared in the letters ascribed
        to John (1 John 2:18, 2:22; 1 John 4:2-3; 2 John 1:7) where it refers to
        people who deny that Jesus is Christ. By the late second century
        "Antichrist" was understood as a false messiah who was expected to come
        at the consummation of the world, before Christ's second coming. Various
        passages from the Old and New Testaments were collected that were now
        understood to speak to this otherwise unnamed figure; this treatise is
        one of the first to bring them together in a more or less systematic
        fashion.<br>
        <br>
        Hippolytus seems to have lived in the late second and early third
        century and left a significant (although disputed) number of treatises,
        particularly biblical commentaries. Late ancient authors knew many works
        ascribed to him, but little about his biography. Eusebius,<em>Church
          History</em> 6.20&nbsp; describes him as "leader of a church" (<em>proestōs
          ekklēsias</em>, προεστὼς ἐκκλησίας) who wrote around the time of
        Origen (mid-third century), and lists several of his texts available in
        the library of "Aelia" (Jerusalem). He does not include <em>On Christ
          and Antichrist</em>. Jerome, <em>On Famous Men</em> 61 likewise
        describes him as "bishop of some church whose city's name I couldn't
        find" (<em>cuiusdam ecclesiae episcopus nomen quippe urbis scire non
          potui</em>), and does list <em>De Antichristo</em> among his
        writings. Later sources refer to the text as <em>On Christ and
          Antichrist</em> or <em>On the coming of Christ and Antichrist.</em><br>
        <br>
        Modern historians have placed Hippolytus in Rome, where he clashed with
        the Bishop Callistus (218-22) and was ordained as a rival bishop before
        dying as a martyr under Maximinus Thrax in 235. He is often taken to be
        the author of a long heresiological treatise known as the <em>Elenchos</em>
        or <em>Refutation omnium haeresium</em>, although some modern scholars
        dispute his authorship. Whatever the truth of Hippolytus's biography,
        the author of this treatise <em>On Christ and Antichrist</em> may be
        identified with the author of other late-second, early-third century
        biblical commentaries; the <em>Commentary on Daniel</em>, written in
        the early third century, explicitly refers back to this treatise.<br>
        <br>
        The author presents to his addressee, Theophilus, a series of
        "propositions" on Antichrist grounded entirely in a chain of scriptural
        passages which are harmonized through a particular theological
        understanding of the end of the world and the culmination of history.
        Not all of the propositions listed in the opening section are treated as
        fully as others, which may indicate that the "propositions" did not
        originate with Hippolytus (perhaps they were posed by Theophilus) or
        that the treatise was composed with some haste. In addition to relying
        heavily on and harmonizing the prophetic book of Daniel and the New
        Testament Revelation to John, Hippolytus draws from Irenaeus's
        second-century <em>Against Heresies</em> 5, which also comprises a
        discussion of the end and Antichrist.<br>
        <br>
        I use the Greek text edited by Enrico Norelli (<em>Ippolito:
          L'Anticristo. De Antichristo</em> [Florence: Nardini, Centro
        Internazionale del Libro, 1987]). Paragraph and sentence number are

      <h3>Introduction: A secure resource from the Scriptures<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>1</b>.1. Since you really wanted to be taught, with accuracy, the
        topics you proposed to me, my beloved brother Theophilus, I thought it
        reasonable, once I drew plentifully from the divine Scriptures like from
        a sacred spring, to furnish the results to you in person;<label for="sn-you-in-person" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input id="sn-you-in-person" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
        <span class="sidenote"><em>kat' ophthalmon</em> (κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμὸν),
          literally "before your eyes"; perhaps Hippolytus is referring to the
          fact that he is presenting a work in writing, rather than merely
          orally; in any case it is clear Hippolytus wants Theophilus to have a
          kind of crib sheet that will help him better internalize the lessons
          of the treatise. The reference to "masses" may indicate that
          Theophilus is instructing unbaptized Christians. The reference to
          "resistant" ones might suggest debates with non-Christians.</span>
        that way you might not only enjoy them by hearing them but, with the
        ability to investigate these same matters, you could glorify God in all
        things. Let this be a secure resource from me to you in this present
        life, so that when you produce them out of ready explanations to those
        masses for whom they are poorly recognized and grasped, you might
        implant them in the depth of your heart, as if in rich and clean earth,
        and then through them confound those who are resistant and opposed to
        the saving Word. 2. But I do fear that you will supply these things to
        faithless and blasphemous tongues, for the risk is not trivial. Share
        them with pious and faithful people, who long to live “<i>in holiness
          and justice</i>” (1 Thess 2:10) with fear. Not in vain did the blessed
        apostle instruct Timothy when he wrote: “<i>Timothy, guard the deposit,
          avoiding the empty profanities and the arguments of falsely-named
          ‘knowledge’; those who proclaim it have strayed concerning the faith</i>”
        (1 Tim 6:20-21). And again: “<i>But you, my child, stay strong in the
          grace which is in Christ Jesus, and what you have heard from me
          through many witnesses, entrust them to faithful people who will be
          sufficient to teach others, also</i>” (2 Tim 2:1-2). 3. So if the
        blessed apostle handed over these things with reverence, things which
        were not familiar to all, foreseeing in the Spirit that “<i>not all have
          faith</i>” (2 Thess 3:2), how much more shall we be at risk if
        indiscriminately and at random we share the sayings of God with profane
        and unworthy men?<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>2</b>.1. Since the blessed prophets became our eyes, foreseeing
        through faith the mysteries of the Word, they administered these things
        to subsequent generations, not only speaking of things in the past but
        also announcing things in the present and the future. This happened so
        the prophet would be shown as a prophet not only at the moment but also
        so he might be considered as a prophet when he was predicting the future
        to all generations. All of them were equipped with a prophetic spirit
        and valued as worthy by the Word himself, like instruments attuned to
        each other, having in them always the Word like a plectrum; moved by it
        they announced the things God willed. 2. The prophets didn’t speak forth
        out of their own power—make no mistake!—nor did the proclaim whatever
        they themselves wanted; but first they were made truly wise through the
        Word; and then, through visions, they were correctly taught the future
        beforehand; and then, sent in this way, they spoke the things which had
        been revealed by God only to them. For what reason would a prophet be
        described as a prophet unless he foresaw the future by the Spirit? If
        the prophet said something about something that had already happened, he
        wouldn’t be a prophet, since he would be talking about things which
        everyone had seen with their own eyes. But he was judged a prophet
        because he rightly predicted the future. This is why, reasonably, the
        prophets from the beginning were called “<i>the seers</i>” (cf. 1 Sam
        9:9 LXX). 3. So we too, having correctly learned the things foretold by
        them, do not speak out of our own imagination.<label for="sn-our-own-imagination" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-our-own-imagination" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
        <span class="sidenote">"imagination" is <em>epinoia</em> (ἐπινοίας),
          meaning conception or idea; the sense is that Hippolytus isn't making
          anything up.</span> We’re not undertaking to invent anything, but
        rather providing the written records of those sayings foretold long ago,
        we bring them to light for those who are able to believe correctly, so
        that it might be of common benefit to both: on the one hand to the
        speaker accurately laying out the propositions while mastering them
        through memory, and on the other to the listener, paying attention to
        what is being said. Now since a common task is proposed to both—the
        speaker to expound securely and the listener to accept what is said with
        a faithful ear—I beseech you also to be joined together with me in
        supplication to God, <b>3</b>.1. so that what was revealed long ago to
        the blessed prophets by the Word of God (now, recall, he is the Son of
        God,<label for="sn-son-of-god" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-son-of-god" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote">Here,
          as elsewhere, Hippolytus uses the locution <em>ho tou theou pais</em>
          (ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ παῖς), rather than the more typical <i>ho huios tou theou</i>
          (ὁ υἱός τοὺ θεοῦ)</span>who was of old the Word but has now also been
        made manifest as a person in the world because of us) he might explain
        them to you through us, those things which you seek to obtain from him
        through prayer. But since the Word demonstrates his own compassion and
        impartiality, roaming about through all the saints;<label for="sn-all-the-saints" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-all-the-saints" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote"><em>dia
            pantōn hagiōn ho logos phoitōn</em> (διὰ πάντων ἁγίων ὁ λόγος
          φοιτῶν); the German edition of the text has <em>phuton</em> (φυτὸν)
          for <em>phoitōn</em> (φοιτῶν), and places it in the next clause which
          would then read: “harmonizing himself <i>as a creature</i> like a
          physician…”</span> calibrating himself like a physician experienced in
        what is good for us, knowing the weakness of humans, he attempts to
        teach the ignorant while turning those who have strayed back to his own
        true path; he is readily found by those who seek him with faith and he
        immediately opens up to those clean bodies and pure hearts desiring to
        knock at the gate. 2. For he casts away none of those enslaved to him,
        he abhors no one as if they are not worthy of his divine mysteries:<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>neither preferring the rich man over the poor nor discounting the poor
        because of their lowliness; <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>neither reproaching the barbarian as unwise nor setting aside the
        eunuch as inhuman;<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>neither hating the female because of her original disobedience nor
        shaming the male because of his transgression;<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>but—<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>having mercy on all and desiring to save all; <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>willing to restore all the children of God;<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>and calling all the saints into one perfect humanity.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>For there is one Son of God, through whom we also encounter rebirth
        through the Holy Spirit, and we all desire to arrive into one perfect
        and celestial humanity.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>4</b>.1. So it is that the Word of God, although fleshless, clothed
        itself with holy flesh from the holy Virgin, like a bridegroom in his
        cloak, weaving it for himself in suffering on the cross, so that in
        uniting our mortal body to his own power, and mixing the corruptible
        with the incorruptible and weakness with force, he might save the
        perishing humanity. 2.<label for="sn-hippolytus-goes-through" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-hippolytus-goes-through" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
        <span class="sidenote">As in his boat analogy below in chapter 59,
          Hippolytus here employs specific technical terms in the service of his
          weaving analogy: beam = <em>histos</em> (ἱστὸς); warp = <em>stēmōn </em>(στήμων);
          woof = <em>krokē</em> (κρόκη); thread = <em>mitos</em> (μίτος);
          shuttle = <em>kerkis</em> (κερκὶς).</span> The beam of the Lord is
        like the suffering which took place on the cross; the warp is the power
        of the Holy Spirit in him; the woof is like the holy flesh woven into
        the Spirit; the thread is the grace sealed through Christ’s love and
        uniting the two into one; the shuttle is the Word; the workers are the
        patriarchs and prophets who are weaving the lovely, floor-length,
        perfect garment of Christ, through whom the Word, moving like a shuttle,
        weaves what the Father wishes through them.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>The nature of Antichrist<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>5</b>.1. But since now the moment is pressing for these
        propositions, and what has been said in the introduction for God’s glory
        suffices on its own, it is right for me, taking hold of the divine
        Scriptures themselves, to show through them:<label for="sn-show-through-them" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

        <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>What and of what sort is the coming of Antichrist? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>On what sort of occasion and in what time will the Lawless one be
        revealed? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>From where and from what tribe, and what is his name, which is declared
        through the number in Scripture?<label for="sn-number-in-scripture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

        corners of the world, and rouse up tribulation and persecution against
        the saints? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>And how will he glorify himself as God? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>What is his consummation? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>How will the manifestation of the Lord be revealed from the heavens? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>And what is the conflagration of the universe? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>What is the glorious and celestial kingdom of the saints who will reign
        together with Christ? <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>And what is the eternal punishment through fire of the lawless ones?<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Christ and Antichrist in parallel<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>6.</b>1. Now insofar as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of
        God,<label for="sn-son-of-god" class="margin-toggles sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-son-of-god" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote">Here
          Hippolytus uses the more common <em>tou hiou tou theou</em> (τοῦ υἱοῦ
          τοῦ θεοῦ) formulation.</span>was proclaimed beforehand as a <i>lion</i>
        (Gen 49:9) because he is regal and glorious, in the same way also the
        Scriptures have prophesied Antichrist similarly as a lion because he is
        tyrannical and brutal. In every way the Deceiver wants to become like
        the Son of God. Christ is a lion, so Antichrist is a lion. Christ is a
        King, so Antichrist is an earthly King. The Savior was shown to be a
        lamb, so also similarly he will appear like a lamb while being a wolf
        inside. The Savior came into the world circumcised, so he will come
        similarly. 2. The Lord sent the apostles into all the nations, so he
        will similarly send false apostles. The Savior assembled the sheep which
        had been scattered, so he similarly will gather up the scattered people.
        The Lord granted a seal to those who believe in him, so he will grant
        similarly. The Lord was manifest in the form of a human, so he will come
        in the form of a human. The Savior rose and demonstrated his own flesh
        as a temple, so he will raise up in Jerusalem a temple in stone. And we
        shall clarify these deceitful tricks of his later on; let us turn to the
        proposition at hand.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Jacob’s benediction<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>7</b>.1 The blessed Jacob says in the benedictions, prophesying in
        advance on matters concerning our Lord and Savior like this: “<i>Judah,
          may your brother praise you; your hands are upon the back of your
          enemies; your father’s sons will bow down before you. A lion’s cub is
          Judah; from a shoot you have risen up, my son; reclining you have
          fallen asleep like a lion and like a cub. Who will rouse him? A leader
          will not fail from Judah nor a ruler from his loins until the one
          comes for whom it is set aside, and he will be the expectation of
          nations. Binding his donkey to a vine and the colt of his donkey to
          the tendril, he will wash his robe in wine and his cloak in grape’s
          blood. His eyes are merry from wine, and his teeth are gleaming like
          milk</i>” (Gen 49:8-12).<o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p><b>8</b>.1. It seems now appropriate to cite these things to you, even
        though you already know how to explain them. But since these same
        phrases exhort us to speak, we shall not neglect it. For they are truly
        divine and glorious, with the ability to help a soul. When he said “<i>a
          lion’s cub</i>” the prophet meant the Son of God who is from Judah and
        David according to the flesh. By saying “<i>from a shoot you have risen
          up, my son</i>” he showed the fruit shooting forth from the holy
        Virgin, not begotten from seed, but conceived from the Holy Spirit, and
        so he comes forth like a holy shoot from the ground. 2. Now Isaiah says:
        “<i>A rod will go out from the root of Jesse, and a flower will rise up
          from it</i>” (Isa 11:1). The “<i>flower</i>” spoken of by Isaiah is
        the “<i>shoot</i>” Jacob has spoken of; for first the Word <em> shot</em>
        forth in the womb and then it <em>flowered</em> in the world. Saying “<i>reclining
          you have fallen asleep, like a lion and like a cub</i>” indicated the
        three-day sleep<label for="sn-three-day-sleep" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-three-day-sleep" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote"><em>koimēsis</em>
          (κοίμησις)</span>of Christ, as also Isaiah says: “<i>How has the
          faithful city become a prostitute, Zion full of judgment? In her in
          whom righteousness slept, now there are murderers</i>” (Isa 1:21). 3.
        And David likewise: “<i>I lay down and slept, and I awoke, because the
          Lord will assist me</i>” (Ps 3:6), so he might show in this phrase the
        sleeping and the resurrection that took place at that time. Jacob says:
        “<i>Who will rouse him?</i>” That is the Father, just as also Paul says:
        “<i>and God the Father who raised him from the dead</i>” (Gal 1:1). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>9</b>. Saying “<i>there will not be a leader out of Judah nor a
          ruler from his loins until the one comes for whom it is set aside, and
          he will be the expectation of nations</i>” indicated that the course
        of the royal descent from Judah would be fulfilled under Christ. For he
        is the “<i>expectation of</i>” we who are the “<i>nations</i>”; for we
        expect him to be coming from the heavens in power; we see him already
        through faith.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>10</b>. “<i>Binding his donkey to a vine</i>”: that is, [binding]
        the people from circumcision to his own calling. For he was the vine. “<i>And
          the colt of his donkey to the tendril</i>”: uniting to him the people
        from the nations, like a young colt, as he was calling circumcision and
        uncircumcision into a single faith.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>11</b>. “<i>He will wash his robe in wine</i>”: the paternal grace
        of the Holy Spirit coming down upon him in the Jordan. “<i>And in
          grape’s blood his cloak</i>”: in the <i>blood</i> of what sort of <i>grape</i>
        except that of his holy flesh, crushed on the wood like a bunch of
        grapes? From its side two wells gushed forth, of blood and of water (cf.
        John 19:34), through which the nations, being washed, are purified: they
        have been reckoned to Christ like a <i>cloak</i>. <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>12</b>. “<i>His eyes are merry from wine</i>.” What are the <i>eyes</i>
        of Christ but the blessed prophets, who foresaw in the spirit and
        proclaimed beforehand the sufferings that would befall him, who were
        able to rejoice when they looked upon him with spiritual eyes, eternally
        strengthened by his Word and his grace?<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>13</b>. And saying “<i>and his teeth are gleaming like milk</i>”
        signified the commandments proceeding forth out of Christ’s holy mouth,
        which are as pure as milk.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Antichrist’s tribe and coming<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>14</b>.1. Now since the Scriptures prophesied Christ as lion and
        lion’s cub, a similar thing is said about Antichrist. For Moses says in
        this way: “<i>Dan is a lion’s cub and he will leap out of Bashan</i>”
        (Deut 33:22). But so that no one might make a mistake, supposing that
        this phrase was said about the Savior, let him pay close attention! He
        says “<i>Dan is a lion’s cub</i>”; in naming the tribe, that of Dan, he
        explained the proposition, from which [tribe] Antichrist is going to be
        born. 2. For just as the Savior has been born out of the tribe of Judah,
        so also Antichrist will be born out of the tribe of Dan. That this is
        the case, what does Jacob say? “<i>Let Dan be a snake, lying on the
          road, biting the horse’s heel</i>” (Gen 49:17). What else is the <i>serpent</i>
        but the Deceiver from the beginning, who is spoken of in Genesis, the
        one who deceived Eve and tripped up Adam?<label for="sn-tripped-up-adam" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

        proposition through many more witnesses, let us not dawdle! <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>15</b>.1. That the tyrant, the king, the fearsome judge, the Devil’s
        son is really is going to be born and rise up out of the tribe of Dan
        the prophet says: “<i>Dan will judge his own people, just as also a
          single tribe in Israel</i>” (Gen 49:16). But someone will say: This
        has been said about Samson, who was born out of the tribe of Dan and
        judged the people for twenty years (cf. Jud 16:31). Part of this has
        happened under Samson, but the entire thing will be fulfilled under
        Antichrist. For also Jeremiah says this: “<i>Speedily out of Dan we
          shall hear the swiftness of his horses, from the thundering sound of
          his cavalry of horses all the earth was shaken”</i> (Jer 8:16). 2. And
        another prophet says: “<i>He will gather all of his power from the East
          to the West; those whom he had called and those whom he had not called
          will go forth with him. He will brighten the sea with the sails of his
          ships and darken the field with shields and weapons. And everyone who

      <p><b>16</b>.1. For Isaiah says it in this way: “<i>And it will be when
          the Lord consummates everything he’s doing on Mount Zion and
          Jerusalem, he will set upon the great mind, upon the leader of the
          Assyrians, and the haughty glory of his eyes. For he said: In might I
          shall do it and in the wisdom of understanding I shall remove the
          boundaries of nations and I shall plunder their might. And I shall
          shake inhabited cities and I shall take hold of the whole world in my
          hand like a nest and like abandoned eggs I shall lift it up. And there
          is no one who will escape from me or resist me</i>. 2. <i>And not in
          this way? But Adonai the Lord will send dishonor against your honor
          and a burning fire will be ignited against your glory. And the light
          of Israel is for fire and it will purify him in flame and it will
          consume the forest like grass</i>” (Isa 10:12-17).<o:p></o:p></p>

          plague, smiting the nation with an angry plague, with which he was not

          ascend above the clouds, I shall be like the Highest One. But now you
          will be cast down into Death and into the foundations of the earth.
          Those who see you will be amazed at you and they will say: He is the
          person who made the earth shudder, who shook kings, who made the whole
          world into wilderness, and he razed the cities, he didn’t release
          those in captivity. </i>3. <i>All the kings of the nations fell

          same way a cloak defiled by blood will not be clean, so you will not
          be clean, because you destroyed my land and slew my people. You will
          not remain forever, an evil seed. Prepare your children to be
          slaughtered for the sins of your father, so that they will not rise up
          and inherit the land</i>” (Isa 14:4-21).<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>18</b>.1. Similarly Ezekiel speaks about him in this way: “<i>The
          Lord God says this: Because your heart has been exalted and you have
          said: ‘I am God, I have inhabited God’s dwelling-place in the heart of
          a sea’; but you are human and not God, and you have treated your heart
          as if it were God’s heart; are you wiser than Daniel? Wise ones have
          not instructed you in their knowledge. Is it by your wisdom or your
          understanding that you gave yourself power, and gold and silver in
          your treasuries? Or by your great knowledge and commerce have you
          increased your power? Your heart has been exalted in your power. </i>2<i>.
          This is why the Lord God says this: Since you treated your heart as if
          it were God’s heart, for this, behold, I bring down upon you strange
          pestilences from the nations, and they will unsheathe their swords
          against you and against the beauty of your knowledge, and they will
          raze your beauty into destruction, and they will degrade you, and you
          will be put to death, wounded in the heart of the sea. Will you not
          speak, saying: ‘I am God’ before those who are destroying you? But you
          are a human, and not God. In the throng of uncircumcised<b> </b>you
          will perish by foreign hands, because I have spoken, says the Lord”</i>
        (Ezek 28:2-10).<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Daniel’s Visions of Antichrist and Christ (Four Kingdoms)<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>19</b>.1. Now that these passages having been explained, let us look
        more closely at what Daniel said in his visions. For when he was
        distinguishing the kingdoms that would come to be afterward, he showed
        also the coming of Antichrist in the end times and the consummation of
        the whole world. So he says when interpreting the visions of
        Nebuchadnezzar: “<i>King, you looked and behold a great image stood
          before your presence; its head was of valuable gold, its arms and
          shoulders of silver, its torso and thighs of bronze, its calves of
          iron, its feet made of one part iron and another part clay. 2. You
          looked until a stone was cut without hands and struck the image in its
          iron-and-clay feet and it shattered them completely. Then at once the
          clay, the iron, the bronze, the silver, the gold were shattered, and
          were like dust on a summer’s threshing floor. And the mighty wind took
          them away and no place was found for them. And the stone striking the
          image became a great hill and filled the whole earth</i>” (Dan
        2:33-35). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>20</b>.1. Now when we combine Daniel’s visions with this other one
        we produce a single account out of both, showing how there might be
        harmony and truth. For he says it like this: “<i>I, Daniel, looked and
          behold the four winds of the heaven crashed into the great sea, and
          four great beasts rose up out of the sea, different from each other.
          The first was like a lioness and its wings were like eagle’s; I looked
          until its wings were plucked; it was raised up from the earth and
          stood on its feet like a human, and a human heart was given to it. And
          behold a second beast similar to a bear, and it was stood on one side
          and it had three ribs in its mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
            </span></i>2<i>. I looked and, behold, another beast like a leopard;
          and it had four bird’s wings above it and the beast had four heads. I
          looked behind it and behold a fourth beast, fearsome and terrible and
          exceedingly mighty, its teeth were iron and its claws were brass,
          chomping and shredding, and it was stomping on the remains with its
          feet. And it was exceedingly different from all the beasts that
          preceded it, and it had ten horns. I was contemplating its horns and
          behold another, small horn rose up in their midst and it ripped out
          the three horns that preceded it from its presence; and behold eyes
          like a human’s were on this horn and a mouth uttering boasts. </i><b>21</b>.
        <i>I looked until thrones were set up and the Ancient of Days was
          sitting and his cloak was like gleaming snow and the hair of his head
          was like pure wool; his throne was a flame of fire, with wheels of
          blazing fire. A river of fire flowed before him, thousands of
          thousands worshiped him and myriads of myriads stood around him. He
          sat in the judgment seat and books were opened. I looked then from the
          sound of the boastful words which that horn was uttering, until the
          beast was destroyed and killed and its mouth was given into burning
          fire. And the rule of the remaining beasts was transferred</i>. <b>22</b>.
        <i>I looked in a night-time vision and behold with the clouds of heaven
          came one like the Son of Man and he arrived unto the Ancient of Days
          and he approached him. And the rule was given to him and the honor and
          the kingdom and all the peoples, tribes, and tongues will be enslaved
          to him. His authority is eternal authority, which does not go away,
          and his kingdom will not pass away</i>” (Dan 7:2-14).<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>23</b>.1. Now since these things, spoken mystically, seem to some
        difficult to understand, we shall conceal nothing about them that leads
        to comprehension for those who possess a sound mind. When it said “<i>a
          lioness rising from the sea</i>” it meant the kingdom of the
        Babylonians coming into the world, which was the golden head of the
        image; “<i>its wings were like eagle’s</i>” because King Nebuchadnezzar
        was exalted and elevated against God. 2. Then, he says, “<i>its wings
          were plucked</i>,” because his glory was diminished: for he was driven
        out of his kingdom. “<i>A human heart was given to it and it was stood
          on human feet</i>” because he repented, recognizing about himself that
        he was a human and he gave glory to God. <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>24</b>.1. After the <i>lioness</i> he sees “<i>a second beast</i>”
        which is “<i>similar to a bear</i>,” which was the Persians. After the
        Babylonians the Persians governed. “<i>Three ribs in its mouth</i>”
        pointed to three nations: the Persians, Medes, and Babylonians, which is
        shown by the <i>silver</i> after the gold on the image. Then the third
        beast is a leopard, which was the Greeks. After the Persians Alexander
        the Macedonian governed, deposing Darius, which is shown by the bronze
        on the statue. 2. “<i>Four bird’s wings</i>” and <i>“four heads</i>” on
        the beast showed very clearly how Alexander’s empire was divided into
        four parts: saying “<i>four heads</i>” disclosed the four kings who rose
        up out of it. For when Alexander died his empire was separated into four
        parts.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>25</b>.1. Then, he says, “<i>a fourth beast, fearsome and terrible…
          its teeth were iron and its claws were brass</i>.” Who are these but
        the Romans? The <i>iron</i> is the empire which presently exists. For
        he says: “<i>its calves were of iron</i>.” For after this what else
        remains, beloved, but the feet of the image, in which <i>“part was of
          iron and another part was of clay, mixed into each other</i>.” 2. He
        indicated in a mystical way through the toes of the feet ten kings
        rising up from it, about which Daniel says: “<i>I was contemplating the
          beast and behold ten horns were on its back among which another, small
          horn will rise up like a shoot and it will root out the three horns
          before it</i>.” <o:p></o:p>What else is shown by this than Antichrist
        when he rises up, who will also be the one who resurrects the kingdom of
        the Jews? 3. The three horns which he says will be uprooted by him shows
        the three kings of Egypt, the Libyans, and the Ethiopians, whom he will
        destroy in the thick of battle; when he rules over all, and is a
        fearsome and cruel tyrant, he will cause tribulation and persecution
        against the saints, roused against them. For Daniel says: “<i>I
          contemplated the horn and behold that horn did battle with the saints
          and was prevailing over them</i>” (Dan 7:21) until “<i>the beast was
          destroyed and killed and its mouth was given into burning fire</i>”
        (Dan 7:11).<o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p><b>26</b>.1. After this he will come from heaven, “<i>the stone which
          strikes the image</i>” and shatters it and transfers all the kingdoms
        and grants the kingdom to the saints of the Most High. He is the one “<i>who
          has become a great hill and fills all the earth</i>” (Dan 2:35), about
        whom Daniel says: “<i>I looked in a night-time vision and behold with
          the clouds of heaven came one like the Son of Man and he arrived unto
          the Ancient of Days. And the rule was given to him and the honor and
          the kingdom and all the peoples, tribes, and tongues will be enslaved
          to him. His authority is eternal authority, which does not go away,
          and his kingdom will not pass away</i>.” 2. He shows the full
        authority which was given from the Father to the Son, who has been
        proven to be king and judge of all those “<i>in heaven and on earth and
          under the earth</i>” (Phil 2:10): “<i>in heaven</i>,” because the Word
        had been begotten out of the Father’s heart before all things; “<i>on
          earth</i>,” because he was begotten as a human among humans, remolding
        Adam through himself; “<i>under the earth</i>,” because he was accounted
        among the dead, bringing the good news to the souls of the saints,
        conquering death through death.<o:p></o:p></p>

        Alexander; the iron calves, the fearsome and terrible beast, the Romans
        who rule now; the soles of the feet of clay and iron, the ten horns,
        which will come in the future; the other small horn springing up among
        them is Antichrist; the stone striking the image and shattering it,

          martyrdom, however, and Hippolytus likewise does not suggest that
          John, the next prophet, died a martyr.</span> Daniel, shall I praise
        you above all? But John does not lie! With how many mouths and tongues

        the things which have been spoken by you have been fulfilled in their
        time. 2. For you saw these things first, then in this way you proclaimed
        God’s sayings to all generations, you ministered to all generations. You
        were called “prophets” so you could save everyone. That’s when a prophet
        really becomes a prophet, when by proclaiming in advance what’s going to
        happen, he shows these things occurring later. You all became students
        of the Good Teacher. I exclaim these things to you deservedly, as if you

        there. You have explained the future about the bear; for you were still
        in the world and you saw these things happen. Then you’re speaking about

        and the he-goat of the goats came, he struck the ram, he shattered his
        horns, and he trampled him underfoot, he conquered, he was exalted. When
        he fell the four horns rose up from beneath him. Rejoice, blessed
        Daniel, you have not been mistaken, all of these things have come to

          brass, chomping and shredding, and it was stomping on the remains with

          subdues and it shreds</i>” (Dan 2:40), behold it subjects all against

        horrible mysteries, and by fulsomely recounting them he also teaches

        you saw and what you heard about Babylon. Wake up and speak, for she

          there by the Romans in exile (see Tertullian, <i>Prescription Against
            Heretics</i> 36; Victorinus of Pettau, <i>On the Apocalypse</i>

          golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurities of the
          fornication of the earth, and on her forehead a name was written, a

          accomplished. And the woman whom you saw is the great city which

          the prison of every unclean and defiled spirit and the prison of every
          unclean and defiled beast, because out of the wrath of the wine of her
          fornication all the nations have fallen, and the kings of the earth
          fornicated with her and the merchants of the earth grew rich out of
          the power of her luxury. And I heard another voice from the heavens
          saying: Come out of her, my people, so you will not be associated with
          her sins, and so you won’t receive a portion of her plagues, because
          her sins have been collected unto heaven and God has remembered her
          injustices.</i> <b>41</b>.1. <i>Render to her just as she has
          rendered, and pay back twofold according to her deeds; in the cup in
          which she mixed you mix for her twofold; as much as she glorified
          herself and luxuriated, you give her as much torture and grief.
          Because she said to herself: because I sit as queen and I am not a
          widow and may I see no grief, because of this on a single day all her
          plagues will come: death and grief and famine, and she will be burned
          up in fire. Because the Lord Almighty is the one judging her. </i>2<i>.
          And the kings of the earth who were fornicating with her and
          luxuriating will wail and mourn for her when they see the smoke from
          her burning, standing at a distance because of fear of her torment,
          saying: Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon the mighty city, that in a
          single hour your judgment has come! And the merchants of the earth
          will wail and grieve over her, because no one buys their wares any
          longer, wares of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and
          linen and silk and purple and red, and all the citron wood and every
          ivory vessel and every vessel out of most precious wood and brass and
          iron and marble and cinnamon and incense and myrrh and cedar and wine
          and oil and wheat and grain and mounts and flocks and horses and
          chariots and bodies and human lives; and the fruit of your soul’s
          desire has gone away from you, and all the comforts and joys have been
          destroyed from you and no longer may you find them.</i> 3. <i>Your
          merchants, who grew rich from her, will stand at a distance because of
          fear of her torture, wailing and grieving and saying: Woe, woe, the
          great city, draped in linen and red and purple, and gilded with gold
          and precious stone and pearl, that in a single hour such wealth has

          burning, saying: Who is like this great city? And they threw dust on
          their heads and they cried out, wailing and grieving, saying: Woe,
          woe, the great city, in which all who had ships on the sea grew rich
          from her expense, that in a single hour she has been made desolate!</i>
        <b>42</b>. <i>Rejoice over her, heaven, and the saints and apostles and
          prophets, because God has rendered your judgment over her. And one
          mighty angel raised up a stone like a great millstone and he cast it
          into the sea, saying: So in violence Babylon the great city will be
          cast down, and it will no longer be found. And the sound of harpists
          and musicians and pipers and trumpeters will not be heard in you, and

          be visible in you and the sound of a bridegroom and the sound of a
          bride will not be heard in you, because your merchants were the great
          men of the earth, because in your alchemy all the nations were
          deceived, and in her the blood of prophets and saints was found and of
          all those slaughtered upon the earth</i>” (Rev 17:1-18:24). <o:p></o:p>
        <i> </i></p>
      <h3>The chronology of Antichrist<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>43</b>.1. As for the tortures and the special judgment which will
        come upon her in the end times from the tyrants who will then exist,
        very clearly have these things been indicated in these passages. But it
        is necessary for us, as we inquire precisely into the chronology, to lay
        out on what occasions these things will happen and how the small horn
        will spring up among them. When the iron legs have prevailed over the
        soles of the feet and the toes, proceeding according to the
        manifestation of the image and the appearance of the fearsome beast,
        just as they have been explained in what came before, on what occasions
        are the iron and the clay mixed together into the same thing? 2. Daniel
        will show us the propositions. For he says: “<i>And a single week will
          make a covenant with many. And it will be in the midst of the week my
          sacrifice and drink-offering will be suspended</i>” (Dan 9:27). When
        he said <i>a single week</i> he meant the last one [week] which will
        come upon the end-point of the whole world at the end-times; of this
        week the two prophets Enoch and Elijah will receive half. For they will
        preach “<i>one thousand two hundred and sixty days, draped in sack-cloth</i>”
        (Rev 11:3), proclaiming repentance to the people and to all the nations.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>44</b>.1. For just as two appearances of our Lord and Savior have
        been shown to us through the Scriptures—the first one happening
        according to the flesh, dishonored because he was despised, just as
        Isaiah predicted when he said: “<i>We saw him, and he did not possess a
          fair form but his form is dishonored and inferior among all people;
          being a man in distress and knowing how to bear weakness, he was
          dishonored and discounted</i>” (Isa 53:2-3); but his second coming has
        been preached in glory, as he will come from the heaven with the power
        of angels and his father’s glory, as the prophet says “<i>you will look
          upon the king with glory</i>” (Isa 33:17) and “<i>they saw upon the
          clouds of heaven one coming like the Son of Man, and he arrived unto
          the Ancient of Days and he approached him. And the rule and the honor
          and the glory and the kingdom were given to him and all peoples,
          tribes, tongues were enslaved to him. His kingdom is an eternal
          kingdom, which will not pass away</i>” (Dan 7:13-14). 2. So also two
        forerunners have been shown: the first one was John the son of
        Zechariah, in every way he was the forerunner and herald of our Savior;
        he gave the good news to all of the heavenly light visible in the world;
        for he came ahead in his mother’s womb, first conceived by Elizabeth in
        order to show to those infants still abiding in their mothers’ wombs the
        new genesis that would come to them through the Holy Spirit and a
        virgin. <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>45</b>. When he “<i>heard Mary’s greeting he leapt in his mother’s
          womb, exulting</i>” (Luke 1:41), observing the Word of God conceived
        in a virgin’s womb. Then, “<i>preaching in the desert</i>” he appeared
        proclaiming the “<i>baptism of repentance</i>” (Mark 1:4) to the people,
        foretelling salvation to the nations dwelling in the desert of the
        world; afterward in the Jordan, upon seeing him he points out the Savior
        and says: “<i>Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world</i>”
        (John 1:29). He also went first to preach the good news to those in
        Death, after he was killed by Herod: he was a forerunner there,
        indicating that the Savior was going to come down to there, redeeming
        the souls of the saints in death’s grip. <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>46</b>.1. But since the Savior was the first-fruit of the
        resurrection of all people, it was necessary for the Lord alone to rise
        from the dead, through whom also the judgment will come against the
        whole world, in order that those who struggled worthily might also be
        worthily crowned by him, by the noble judge of games,<label for="sn-judge-of-games" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-judge-of-games" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote"><em>kalou
            agōnothetou</em> (καλοῦ ἀγωνοθέτου); referee</span> the first to
        have won the race, who was received into the heavens and seated at the
        right hand of God and the Father, and who once more will be visible as
        the judge at the consummation of the world. 2. It is absolutely
        necessary for his forerunners to appear first, just as he says through
        Malachi the messenger: “<i>I shall send you Elijah the Tishbite before
          the great day of the Lord comes and before he appears, who will
          restore the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient
          ones in the prudence of the just, so that when I come I shall not
          smite the earth utterly</i>” (Mal 3:22-23). So they who are present
        will preach the future appearance which is coming from heaven, and they
        will perform signs and wonders for shaming and turning people to
        repentance because of their excessive transgression and impiety.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>47</b>.1. John says: “<i>And I shall give my two witnesses and they
          will prophecy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, draped in
          sack-cloth</i>”—that is, the half-week about which Daniel spoke—“<i>they
          are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand before the Lord
          of the earth: and if someone should wish to harm them, fire will
          proceed out of their mouths and consume their enemies. And if someone
          wishes to harm them, so he must be killed. They have the authority to
          close the heaven so that no rain will fall during the days of their
          prophecy and they have the authority over the waters, to turn them
          into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they
          wish.</i> 2. <i>And when they finish their race and their witness</i>”
        what does the prophet say? “<i>The beast, which is rising out of the
          pit, will wage war with them and he will defeat them and kill them</i>”
        (Rev 11:3-7), because they are unwilling to grant glory to Antichrist
        (that is, the little horn which has sprung up) who, having been puffed
        up in his heart, begins to exalt himself and glorify himself as God,
        persecuting the saints and blaspheming against Christ, just as Daniel
        says: “<i>I was considering the horn and behold eyes like a person’s on
          the horn and a mouth uttering boasts</i>” (Dan 7:8)<i> </i>“<i>and he
          opened his mouth for blasphemy toward God</i>” (Rev 13:6) “<i>and that
          horn waged war with the saints and prevailed against them, until the
          beast was removed and destroyed and his body was given over to burning
          of fire</i>” (Dan 7:21).<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Antichrist’s name and number<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>48</b>.1. But since it is necessary to recount most carefully about
        him—how the Holy Spirit indicated his name mystically through a
        number—we shall recount these things very clearly about him. For John
        says it like this: “<i>And I saw another beast rising up out of the
          earth and it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. And
          it produced all authority of the first beast on his behalf. </i>2. <i>And
          it makes the earth and all those dwelling in it bow down to the first
          beast, whose death blow was healed. And it makes great signs so that
          it might make fire come down from heaven onto the earth before humans
          and it deceives those dwelling on the earth through the signs which
          were given to it to make on behalf of the beast, telling those
          dwelling on the earth to make an image of the beast, which had the
          sword-blow and lived. And it was granted to it to give breath to the
          image of the beast so that the image of the beast might speak and it
          might cause as many to die as would not bow down before the image of
          the beast.</i> 3. <i>And he causes all, small and great and rich and
          poor and free and enslaved, that he might give to them the mark on
          their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or
          sell unless they had the mark, the name of the beast or the number of
          his name. There is wisdom here! Let the one possessing understanding
          calculate the number of the beast: for the number is a person’s. And
          his number is 666</i>” (Rev 13:11-18). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>49</b>.1. Now the “<i>beast rising up out of the earth</i>” means
        the kingdom of Antichrist that will be and the “<i>two horns</i>” are
        the false prophet with him. To say “<i>two horns like a lamb</i>” means
        that he wants to be equated with the Son of God and he presents himself
        as a king. To say “<i>he spoke like a dragon</i>” means that he is a
        deceiver and not truthful. 2. “<i>And he made all the authority of the
          first beast and makes the earth and all those dwelling on it bow down
          to the first beast, whose death blow was healed”</i> means that,
        according to the law of Augustus, from which the Roman Empire was
        constituted, so too will he command and bring order, deciding all
        things, and through this he will acquire greater glory for himself. For
        this is the fourth beast, whose head was wounded and once more was
        healed—because it was demolished and dishonored and broken up into ten
        crowns and then, since he is clever, as it were, he will heal it and
        reunite it.<label for="sn-and-reunite-it" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-and-reunite-it" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> <span class="sidenote">Hippolytus
          seems to imagine a Rome-style empire reconstituted out of the ten
          "democracies" (see above, Chapter 17) by Antichrist, perhaps even a
          New Rome.</span> 3. For this is what was said by the prophet, that “<i>he
          will give breath to the image and the image of the beast will speak</i>”:
        for he will be effective and capable once more through the laws
        determined by him, and he will put to death as many as will not bow down
        to the image of the beast. “<i>Here the faith and the endurance of the
          saints</i>” will be clear (Rev 13:10). For he says: “<i>and it causes
          all, small and great and rich and poor and free and enslaved, that he
          might give them the mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so
          that no one will be able to buy or sell unless they have the mark or
          the number of his name</i>.” 4. Now since he is wily and puffed up
        against those enslaved to God, wanting to afflict them sorely and
        persecute them out of the world because they won’t grant him glory, he
        commands everyone everywhere to set up censers, so that no one of the
        saints will be able to buy or sell unless they first offer sacrifice.
        For this is “<i>the mark</i> given <i>on the right hand</i>.” He says “<i>on
          the forehead</i>” because all will be crowned, wearing among
        themselves a fiery crown not of life but of death. 5. For this is what
        Antiochus Epiphanes devised against the Jews, when he, who was of
        Alexander of Macedon’s lineage, became King of Syria. For he too in
        those times then, puffed up in his heart, wrote a decree that altars
        should be set up before the gates for all to sacrifice, and that they
        should process for Dionysus, crowned with ivy; and those who didn’t want
        to do it would be subjected and they would be destroyed with sacrificial
        meat-eating and trials and tortures (cf. 2 Macc 6-7). But he received
        the same in return from the Lord and righteous Judge and all-observant
        God, a similar torture: for he gave up his life being eaten away by
        worms.<label for="sn-away-by-worms" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-away-by-worms" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote">That
          is, the punishment of forcing impure food on Jews was inverted by

        to examine these things more carefully, they have been explained in the
        [books of] Maccabees.<o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p><b>50</b>.1. But now we shall speak to the proposition. These things he
        is also devising in this way, in his desire to afflict the saints in all
        things. For the prophet and apostle says: “<i>Here there is
          understanding. Let the one having wisdom calculate the number of the
          beast: for it is a person’s number, and his number is 666</i>.” About
        his name it’s not possible for us to expound precisely, in the way the
        blessed John understood and was taught about it, but only in
        supposition: for when he appears, the occasion will show the answer. 2.
        But as much as we understand, even shakily, let us say. For we find many
        names equaling this number, for example, let us say, there is <i>Titan</i>,<label for="sn-there-is-titan" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-there-is-titan" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote">These

          τ=300;&nbsp; ν=50. This name seems to be Irenaeus's favorite.</span>

        <input id="sn-name-or-euanthas" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote">"Euanthas"/Εὐάνθας:

            H. Colson</a> speculated this unusual name was an attempt to come up
          with a Greek equivalent of <em>Florus</em> that equaled 666.</span>
        For this also is equal to that number, and a great many others can be
        found. 3. But since we were already saying that the first beast’s wound
        was healed and he will make the image speak, that is he has prevailed,
        and it is manifest to all that the rulers now are the Latins, the name
        translated into that of a single person becomes “Latinus,”<label for="sn-person-becomes-latinus" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

          he believes Antichrist will reconstitute a Roman-style empire.</span>
        so that we should neither pronounce that this is really it nor, again,
        ignore that it might not be able to be reckoned otherwise; since we, who
        “<i>have the mystery of God in a pure heart</i>” (1 Tim 3:9) faithfully
        keep, with fear, the things said by the blessed prophets so that we
        won’t fail to recognize when these things are happening. For when the
        times arrive and he, about whom these things have been said, will be
        made manifest and the name will be indicated clearly to all.<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Antichrist’s lineage<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>51</b>. So that we don’t persuade those who labor over God’s sayings
        from these passages alone, let us demonstrate through other, more
        fulsome proofs. For Daniel says: “<i>and they will be saved from his
          hand, Edom and Moab and the rule of the sons of Ammon</i>” (Dan
        11:41). For they are also the ones joined together with him through
        kinship, revealing that he is their king. For Edom are the sons of Esau
        and Ammon and Moab are the sons who were born from the daughters of Lot,
        from whom their lineage exists until now. For Isaiah also says: “<i>and
          they will fly about in foreigners’ boats: plundering the sea together
          and those from the East, they will cast their hands first against
          Moab, first the sons of Ammon will obey</i>” (Isa 11:14). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Antichrist glorified as God<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>52</b>.1. Now this one, once he has been proclaimed by them and has
        conquered in the field of war the three horns out of the ten horns and
        having rooted them out—the ones belonging to Egypt and to the Libyans
        and Ethiopians— once he has taken their arms and spoils, while the seven
        remaining horns who are left over have been subordinated to him, then he
        will begin to be exalted in his own mind and puffed up against God, as
        he rules the entire world. 2. First his violence will be against Tyre
        and Sidon and territory around them. When he has first plundered these
        cities he will engender fear in the others, just as Isaiah says: “<i>Be
          ashamed, Sidon, said the sea; for the might of the sea said: I have
          not been in labor and I have not born a child, nor have I reared young
          men nor raised up virgins; whenever it is heard in Egypt, pain will
          take hold of them concerning Tyre</i>” (Isa 23:4-5). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>53</b>. When these things take place like this, dearest one, and the
        three horns are cut off by him, afterward he will begin to portray
        himself as God, as Ezekiel foretold: “<i>Because your heart has been
          exalted you said: I am God</i>” (Ezek 28:2). And Isaiah likewise: “<i>You
          said in your heart: I shall rise up into heaven, I shall place my
          throne above the stars of the heaven, I shall be like the Most High.
          But now you shall be brought down into Death and into the foundation
          of the earth</i>” (Isa 14:13-15). So too also Ezekiel: “<i>Will you
          speak and say to those who are destroying you, I am God? But you are a
          human and not God</i>” (Ezek 28:9).<o:p></o:p></p>
      <h3>Antichrist rouses people to persecute the saints<o:p></o:p></h3>
      <p><b>54</b>.1. Now that these passages have demonstrated his tribe and
        appearance and destruction, and his name has been mystically indicated,
        let us also look at his activity. For he will summon all the people to
        him out of all the territory of the diaspora, claiming them as his own,
        like his own children, announcing to them that he is restoring the
        territory and raising up their kingdom and temple so that he will be
        worshiped by them as God, as the prophet says: “<i>He will gather all of
          his power from the East until the West, those whom he had called and
          those whom he had not called will go forth with him</i>.”<label for="sn-forth-with-him" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-forth-with-him" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> <span class="sidenote">Hippolytus
          also cites this unknown prophet above in Chapter 15.</span>2. And
        Jeremiah says this, using a parable for him: “<i>A partridge called out,
          it gathered those it had not given birth to; making its wealth without
          judgment, in old age they will leave him behind and he will be foolish
          at the end of his days</i>” (Jer 17:11 LXX). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>55.</b>1. It will do no harm, because of the proposition, also to
        explain the technique of this animal and that the prophet did not make
        his point in vain using the parable of the animal.<label for="sn-of-the-animal" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input id="sn-of-the-animal" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"> <span class="sidenote">While
          the Hebrew of Jeremiah has the partridge "hatching" (דָגַל) those to
          which it did not give birth, in the Septuagint the partridge has
          "called out to" (ἐφώνησεν) them. Third- and fourth-century sources
          interpreting this passage, such as the <em>Physiologus</em>, Origen,
          and Jerome, introduce the idea that partridges steal other birds eggs
          which then return to their natural parents when they hatch. Hippolytus
          uniquely has the partridges mimicking the voice of other hatchlings'
          parents, which better serves his parallel of the Antichrist pretending
          to be Christ.</span> Now since the partridge is a vain type of animal,
        when it sees nearby the nest of another partridge having chicks, while
        their father is off in search of food, it imitates the call of the other
        one and summons the chicks to him. Since they think he is their own
        father, they run off to him. 2. So it preens at another’s offspring like
        its own. But when the real father comes back and cries out with its own
        call, the chicks recognize it and, abandoning the counterfeit, they go
        to their real father. Likewise the prophet used this simile when
        speaking about Antichrist, who will summon humanity to him, wishing to
        claim another’s as his own, announcing empty liberation to all, unable
        to save even himself. <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>56</b>. Once he has collected to himself from everywhere the people
        who have become disobedient to God, he begins exhorting that the saints
        be persecuted by them, as if they are their enemies and opponents, just
        as the evangelist says: “<i>There was a certain judge in a certain city
          who didn’t fear God and had no respect for person. There was a certain
          widow in that city who exhorted him, saying: Vindicate me from my
          opponent. But he did not want to at the time; but later he said to
          himself: Even if I don’t fear God and respect person, because this
          widow is bothering me I shall vindicate her</i>” (Luke 18:2-5). <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><b>57</b>.1. Now the <i>judge</i> of <i>injustice</i> who doesn’t <i>fear
          God or respect person</i> indubitably means Antichrist, who is the son
        of the Devil and vessel of Satan and, when reigning, will also begin to
        be puffed up against God, truly <i>not fearing God nor respecting</i>
        the Son of God who is the Judge of all. The <i>widow</i> whom he says
        was <i>in the city</i> means Jerusalem itself, which is truly a widow,
        forsaken by her perfect and heavenly bridegroom, who seeks vindication
        from a mortal human as if harmed by Christ. 2. Calling him her <i>opponent</i>
        and not savior, not acknowledging what was said by Jeremiah the prophet:
        “<i>because they rejected the truth at that time a spirit of error will
          speak to this people and to Jerusalem</i>” (Jer 4:11). And Isaiah
        likewise: “<i>this people, because they did not wish to drink the water
          of Siloam which goes forth in peace, but they were drawn back by
          themselves to Rezin the king of the Assyrians</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”
          (Isa 8:6-7). </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

          figure for Antichrist, just as also another prophet says: “</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">And
          this same peace will come from me when the Assyrian comes upon your
          land and ascends your hills</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”

      <p><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">58</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.1.
          And Moses also knows in advance that the people will reject and cast
          away the true </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">“savior of the world</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">” (John
          4:42), that they will join together, in error, to choose an earthly
          king and that they will set aside a heavenly one; he says: “</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">behold
          have these things not been gathered alongside me, and have they been
          sealed in my treasuries? On the day of vindication I shall give in
          return and in that moment whenever their foot fails</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”
          (Deut 32:34-35). 2. They have failed in every way, in nothing have
          they been found to be in harmony with the truth: not according to the
          law, because they became transgressors; nor according to the prophets,
          because they destroyed the prophets themselves; nor according to the
          voice of the gospels, because they have crucified the savior himself;
          nor were they persuaded by the apostles, because they persecuted them
          severely, being at all times plotters and betrayers of the truth,
          found to be haters of God rather than friends of God; and some,
          seizing the opportunity, beseech from a mortal man to gain
          vindication, aroused against those who are enslaved to God. 3. This
          one, having been puffed up by them, begins to send warrants against
          the saints to root all of them out everywhere, since they don’t want
          to venerate him or worship him as God, just as Isaiah says: “</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

          birth. And the dragon stood opposite the woman who was going to give
          birth, so that when she gave birth he might consume her offspring. And
          she gave birth to a male son, who is going to be the shepherd of all
          the nations. And her offspring was snatched away to God and to his

          times and a half time from the presence of the serpent. And the
          serpent cast out of his mouth behind the woman a lot of water so that
          he might cause her to be swept away. And the earth helped the woman
          and the earth opened up its mouth and drank the river which the dragon
          cast from its mouth. And the dragon grew angry at the woman and went
          away to make war with the rest of her seed which was guarding the
          commandments of God and possessing the witness of Jesus</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”

          indicated very obviously the Church, robed in the paternal word

the

          prophets proclaimed, whom the Church, always giving birth, teaches to
          all the nations. 2. Saying “</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">her
          offspring was snatched away to God and to his throne</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”
          means that he is a heavenly king and not an earthly one, begotten

          as though through us, such that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no
          one deceive you in any way: unless the apostasy comes first and the
          sinful person is revealed, the son of destruction, the adversary and
          the one exalted above every so-called god and object of worship, such
          that he sits in the temple of God, displaying himself as if he is God</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.

          already the mystery of transgression is at work, only as long as the
          one restraining him goes away. And then the transgressor will be
          revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy by the breath of his mouth
          and he will abolish him in the appearance of his coming, he whose
          coming is according to the operation of Satan, false in every power
          and in signs and wonders and in every deceit of injustice to those

          life and others for reproach and eternal shame</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

          the dew from you is a cure for them</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”

          they will live</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">” (John

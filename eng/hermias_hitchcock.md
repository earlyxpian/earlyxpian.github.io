# A Skit on Greek Philosophy: By one Hermias, probably of the reign of Julian, A.D. 361-363

This translation of Hermias's *Derision of Heathen Philosophers* (also known as *Gentilium Philosophorum Irrisio*) was done by Francis Ryan Montgomery Hitchcock and published in the journal *Theology* in 1936 (Volume 32, Issue 188, pages 98-106). F. R. Montgomery Hitchcock died in 1951 and therefore this translation is in the public domain in any countries which have a copyright term of 70 years after the death of the author (most countries). In the U.S.A this translation should enter into the public domain in 2032.

This translation does not include the first few sentences of the first chapter.

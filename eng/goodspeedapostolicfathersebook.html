<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The group of early Christian writings known as <i>The Apostolic
Fathers</i> was first formed in the seventeenth century, when a
series of short works came to light and were published, which
seemed to that uncritical generation to be from the hands of men
who were the disciples of the original apostles, or at least might
have known them. The first of these were I and II Clement. It
was the coming of the Codex Alexandrinus to London in 1628,
as a gift from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the King of
England, that first made I and II Clement known to Western
learning, and Patrick Young, the King’s librarian, lost no time
in publishing them both, as the Letters of Clement, in 1633. In
the same year, Halloix published the Greek text of Polycarp’s
Letter to the Philippians, chapters 1-9, all that has ever been
found in Greek, except for the thirteenth chapter, so obligingly
quoted by Eusebius.</p>

<p>In 1645 Ménard d’Achery published the Greek text of Barnabas
(5.7-21.9), and the Greek text of the Letters of Ignatius made
their appearance in Greek, edited by Voss, in 1646. The idea of
assembling these subapostolic figures into a collection led Cotelier
in 1672 to publish the works of the holy fathers “qui temporibus
apostolicis floruerunt,” and twenty-seven years later Ittig, in
1699, repeated the feat in his “Library of the Apostolic Fathers”
(Bibliotheca Patrum Apostolicorum). In modern times Dressel
published an edition of the collection in Leipzig in 1857; Gebhardt,
Harnack, and Zahn issued one there in 1876-1877; while
Funk brought out his first edition in 1881. The Lightfoot-Harmer
<span class="pb" id="page_x"><b class="pb">{Page x}</b></span>
Apostolic Fathers, embodying the Greek texts Lightfoot had
worked out for most of the documents, appeared in 1891, two
years after his death. Hemmer, Oger, Laurent and others produced
the Paris edition, <i>Les Pères Apostoliques</i>, in 1907-1910,
and Lake’s edition of texts and translations appeared in the Loeb
Library in 1912-1913. These have generally sought to keep pace
with the new discoveries of papyrus fragments and Oriental
versions that have been made. Bihlmeyer in 1924 published the
first volume of a text edition, revising the text of Funk; I cannot
learn that his second volume has appeared. It was to comprise
a new edition of Hermas, which Bihlmeyer postponed in order
to take advantage of the anticipated publication of the important
Michigan papyrus of Hermas, assigned to the third century,
which had been announced in 1923, but was not fully published
until 1934. It preserves an ancient text of Parables ii.8 to ix.5:1,
with some fourteen gaps, and enables us to control the Athos
Greek text for these portions. I have made constant use of its
testimony, in Campbell Bonner’s fine edition (1934), to correct
and improve Lake’s text in his Apostolic Fathers in the Loeb
Classical Library.</p>

<p>The canon of the Apostolic Fathers has varied greatly in these
various editions. Cotelier included Barnabas, Hermas, Clement,
Ignatius, and Polycarp, both the Letter and the Martyrdom. But
additions have been made with more or less reason, until the
Didache, the fragments of Papias, the fragment of Quadratus
and the so-called Letter to Diognetus have been included. I
have ventured even further and propose the inclusion of the
Doctrina, which can now be shown to be the source of the Greek
Didache, and of the Greek Barnabas, as well as of most of the
later documents that have long been regarded as reproducing
material from the Greek Didache. To establish this position, a
table exhibiting the parts of the leading documents involved has
been presented as an appendix to this volume.</p>

<p>The various pieces have been variously arranged by recent
<span class="pb" id="page_xi"><b class="pb">{Page xi}</b></span>
editors. A strictly chronological order would separate II Clement
widely from I and be in other respects confusing. I have begun
with Doctrina, as almost the oldest and certainly the most
primitive document in the list, following it with the kindred
pieces Didache and Barnabas. I Clement is doubtless the next
oldest after Doctrina, and with it should go the so-called II
Clement. Modern study has shown Hermas to belong at the
very end of the first century, rather than toward the middle of
the second, as the Muratorian Canon so misleadingly suggests.
Ignatius and Polycarp fall about A.D. 107-117, and while the
Martyrdom of Polycarp is forty or fifty years later, it is natural
to append it to Polycarp’s letter. Quadratus, A.D. 125-129, Papias,
about 140, and the Address to Diognetus (third century?) form
a miscellaneous group, chronologically arranged.</p>

<p><i>The Apostolic Fathers</i> include some of the earliest Christian
writings outside the New Testament that have come down to us,
and for the study of early Christianity constitute a most important
supplement to the New Testament itself.</p>

<p>Definite advances in textual materials for Hermas, and even
at a few points in Greek lexicography, as well as the need of a
franker, more modern and unflinching translation are reflected
in the present version. And the literary relationships of the
several writings to one another and to the books of the New
Testament can now in some cases be more definitely determined.</p>

<p>This translation is based on the Funk-Bihlmeyer edition, vol.
1, published at Tübingen in 1924, except for the Shepherd of
Hermas, which I have translated from Lake’s edition in the
Loeb Library, (1913), with occasional emendations derived
from the papyri.</p>

<h2>The Teaching of the Apostles—The Doctrina</h2>

<p>Over against Paul’s bold doctrine of the all-sufficiency of faith,
and probably at Antioch, about the end of the first century,
Christians more in the Jewish tradition thought it necessary to
draw up a set of rules of conduct, which would make the Christian’s
practical moral obligations more definite. For this leaflet
they claimed the authority of the Twelve Apostles, naming it
The Teaching of the Apostles. It is predominantly negative,
telling what sins to avoid. It depicts first the Way of Life in some
seventy short commands, most of them prohibitions, in the style
of the Ten Commandments, and then in a list of almost forty
more the Way of Death, not neglecting the characteristic heathen
practices of magic, astrology, and enchantment. But it is totally
lacking in art or genius, and seems to attempt to foist the essence
of the old legalism upon the new religion, reducing its living
faith to the keeping of a set of rules.</p>

<p>No Greek manuscript of this curious little work has yet come
to light, and the two known Latin manuscripts of it or part of it,
have been mistaken for translations of the Didache. One Latin
fragment containing the first part of it was published more than
two hundred years ago from a Melk manuscript of the tenth
century, by Bernhard Pez, the Melk librarian. When in 1883 the
Greek Didache was published, this Latin fragment of the
Doctrine was generally accepted as a portion of a Latin translation
<span class="pb" id="page_2"><b class="pb">{Page 2}</b></span>
of the Didache. But in 1899 in a Munich manuscript of the
eleventh century a second Latin text was discovered, which went
right on with about four times as much similar material, to a
well-rounded liturgical conclusion. This too has been generally
accepted as a Latin version of Didache 1-6a.</p>

<p>But as a translation of the Didache into Latin, the Doctrina,
to call it by its Latin name, leaves much to be desired, for, in the
first place, it covers less than the first half of Didache and, in the
second, of this half it leaves out almost a fifth, and this fifth consists
of enrichments of the text by appropriations from five
different works, mostly from the Sermon on the Mount—just the
sort of thing that would creep into the document when it was
being expanded, but not at all the sort of thing that any translator
worth the name would leave out of it. Further, the Doctrina is
rounded off with a liturgical ending, much better than that of the
Didache. These are not at all the traits we should expect in a
translation.</p>

<p>So much for the internal evidence. But the external is even
more convincing. It has been loosely claimed that the Didache,
or most of it, was incorporated into a whole list of subsequent
Christian writings, but a closer examination shows that it is the
Greek original of the Doctrina, not the Didache, that was
wrought into the Greek Barnabas, the <i>Apostolic Church Ordinances</i>,
about A.D. 300, the <i>Summary of Doctrine</i>, A.D. 350-370, the
<i>Fides Nicaena</i>, A.D. 375-381, and the Coptic <i>Life of Schnudi</i>;
while it was the fuller Greek Didache that was worked into the
<i>Didascalia</i>, A.D. 250-300, and the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, about
A.D. 380. Most of the literary influence, in fact, that has long
been claimed for the Didache rightfully belongs to the Greek
original of the Doctrina. More definite evidence for this view of
the Doctrina will be found in the Appendix.</p>

<p>If, as I suppose, Paul’s letters were first published not long
<span class="pb" id="page_3"><b class="pb">{Page 3}</b></span>
before A.D. 95, such a counterblast as the Doctrina represents
would probably be written not long after, perhaps toward the
year 100.</p>

<h2>The Teaching of the Apostles—The Doctrina</h2>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>There are two ways in the world, that of life and that of death,
of light and of darkness. Over them are set two angels, one
of right, the other of wrong. Moreover there is a great difference
between the two ways. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The way of life is this: first, you shall
love the eternal God who made you; second, your neighbour as
yourself. Moreover, anything that you would not have done to
you, you shall not do to anyone else.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Now the meaning of these words is this:</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>You shall not commit adultery, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>you shall not commit murder,
you shall not bear false witness, you shall not corrupt a boy,
you shall not commit fornication, you shall not practise magic,
you shall not use enchanted potions, you shall not murder a
child by abortion, nor kill one when it is born, you shall not
desire any of your neighbour’s goods, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>you shall not commit perjury,
you shall not speak evil, you shall not hold a grudge, <sup class="verse">4 </sup>or
show duplicity in giving advice, or be double-tongued, for the
tongue is a deadly snare. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Your speech shall not be vain or false.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>You shall not be covetous or avaricious, or rapacious or an
idolater, or contentious or ill-humoured. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You shall not entertain
an evil design against your neighbour. You shall hate nobody;
some you shall love more than your own soul.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>My son, flee from an evil man, and from everyone like him.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Do not be irascible, for anger leads to murder, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>nor shall you be
eager for malice, or proud, for all these things breed anger. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Do
<span class="pb" id="page_6"><b class="pb">{Page 6}</b></span>
not be an astrologer, or an enchanter, which things lead to
idolatry, and do not want to look at them or hear them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Do not
be a liar, since lying leads to theft, or a lover of money or vain.
For all these things breed thefts. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Do not be a grumbler, for it
leads to cursing. Do not be self-willed, or evil-minded, for all
these things breed curses. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But be meek, for the meek will possess
the holy land. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Be long-suffering and upright in your business
and reverent of all the words that you hear. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>You shall not exalt
yourself or honour yourself among men, or admit arrogance to
your soul. You shall not join yourself in soul with higher men, but
you shall associate with upright and humble men. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>You shall
accept the adversities that befall you as good, knowing that
nothing happens without God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Night and day you shall remember the one who speaks the
word of the Lord God to you; you shall honour him as the Lord.
For the Lord is in the place from which his words come. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Moreover,
you shall seek the faces of the saints, to refresh yourself
with their words. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You shall not cause divisions. Reconcile those
who are quarrelling. Judge justly, knowing that you will be
judged. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>You shall not discourage anyone in his misfortune, nor
shall you doubt whether it will be true or not. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Do not keep
stretching out your hands to receive, and drawing them back
when it comes to returning. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>If through your hands you have
earned a ransom for your sins, <sup class="verse">7 </sup>you shall not hesitate to give it,
or grumble when you give, for you know who is the good payer
of such wages. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>You shall not turn away from the needy, but
shall share everything with your brethren, and you shall not say
it is your own. For if we are partners in what is immortal, how
much more ought we to consecrate from it! For the Lord wishes
to give of his gifts to all. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>You shall not withhold your hand from
your sons, but from their youth up you shall teach them the
fear of the Lord. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>You shall not give orders in your anger to your
man or woman slave, who hope in the same Lord; let him fear
both the Lord and you. For he came not to call men with
<span class="pb" id="page_7"><b class="pb">{Page 7}</b></span>
partiality, but those in whom he found the Spirit. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>You slaves,
moreover, be subject to your masters, as a symbol of God, with
modesty and trembling. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>You shall hate all hypocrisy, and you
shall not do anything that is not pleasing to the Lord. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>Therefore,
my son, keep what you have heard, and do not add to them what
is contrary to them, or take anything from them. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>Do not approach
prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way of life.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>But the way of death is the opposite of it. First, it is bad and
full of curses,—adulteries, murders, false witness, fornications,
base desires, magic arts, enchantments, thefts, idolatry, robberies,
hypocrisies, pride, malice, willfulness, covetousness, foul
speech, jealousy, insolence, boastfulness, exaltation, falsity. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Not
fearing God, persecutors of good men, hating truth, loving falsehood,
ignorant of the wages of truth, not adhering to the good,
not giving just judgment, lying awake not for good but for evil;
from whom gentleness is far away, and to whom boastfulness
is close, seeking those who will reward them, without pity for the
poor, not grieving for one who is grieved, not recognizing their
creator, murderers of their sons, abortionists, turning away from
good works, oppressing one who is afflicted, neglecting the appeals
of the upright.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>Abstain, my son, from all these things, and see that no one
leads you astray from this Teaching; otherwise, you will be
taught outside the true instruction. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>If you do these things daily
with reflection, you will be near the Living God, but if you do
not do them, you will be far from the truth. Lay up all these
things in your mind, and you will not be disappointed in your
hope, but through these sacred contests you will attain the
crown, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who reigns and rules with
God the Father and the holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h2>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles—The Didache</h2>

<p>Before the churches had reached agreement as to what books
should be read in church, and before Christian practices in
prayer and worship had become fixed, Christian leaders felt the
need of a brief handbook that would regulate church rites and
practices. Country churches especially would need to know what
to do about travelling missionaries and prophets, and what hospitality
to extend to them. And toward the middle of the second
century, such a little church manual was prepared, probably in
the region of Antioch, and appended to the useful summary of
Christian morals already widely used, known as <i>The Teaching
of the Apostles</i>. Indeed, it took over the name of this little
code, and presented itself as an enlarged edition of that work,
under the title “The Teaching of the Lord through the Twelve
Apostles for the Heathen.”</p>

<p>The writer did not hesitate to enrich his inherited code of
Christian morals with a block of sentences from Matthew,
Luke-Acts, 1 Peter, Hermas, (Commands ii.4-6) and an unknown
work (1.6) thus making up Didache 1.3-2.1—a clear indication
that the Greek Didache is not a primary document but is built
up out of earlier ones. This secondary character of the Didache
is also plainly indicated by the abruptness with which it turns
from its bare code of morals, “thou shalt” and “thou shalt not,”
to its new materials: “About food, bear what you can,” 6.3.
<span class="pb" id="page_10"><b class="pb">{Page 10}</b></span>
This new part consists of simple authoritative directions about
fasting, prayer, the Lord’s Supper, the treatment of visiting
Christians, especially prophets, (who seem to have become a
problem in the churches), contributions, worship on the Lord’s
Day, and church officers. An apocalyptic cento made up of a
score of echoes of Matthew, Paul’s letters, Luke-Acts, Barnabas,
and the Revelation, concludes the little pamphlet.</p>

<p>The writer’s gospel is Matthew; he does not know the fourfold
gospel, and his use of Luke is to be explained by his possession
of Luke-Acts; in the Lords Supper, he holds to the Lucan order,
with the cup preceding the bread, against Paul, Mark, and
Matthew. But on the welcome to be extended to itinerant missionaries
(“apostles”) and prophets, he virtually refers his readers
to the Gospel of Matthew, (10:40-41), which he describes simply
as “the Gospel,” and goes on to repeat its injunction on the
subject. His Lord’s Prayer too is in Matthew’s form: on the
subject of prayer and charity he again refers them to “the
Gospel of the Lord,” evidently meaning Matthew 6:1-15. It is
to guide them in all their acts. Like the writer of the Pastoral
Epistles, he holds to the twofold ministry, bishops and deacons.</p>

<p>Most of the literary influence so long claimed for the Didache
really belongs to the primitive form of it, the original Greek
Doctrine, but the Didascalia, late in the third century, and the
Apostolic Constitutions, late in the fourth, clearly made use of
the full form of the Greek Didache.</p>

<p>Lost for centuries, the Didache was discovered in a Greek
manuscript at Constantinople in 1873, and published by Bryennius
ten years later. Two small Greek fragments have since
been published from two leaves of a parchment manuscript
found at Oxyrhynchus, and a longer Coptic fragment in the
British Museum was published in 1924. Two extracts in Ethiopic
also have come to light, and a Georgian version.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_11"><b class="pb">{Page 11}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles—The Didache</h2>

<p>The Teaching of the Lord to the Heathen by the Twelve
Apostles.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>There are two ways, one of life and one of death, and there
is a great difference between the two ways.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>The way of life is this: first, you shall love God, who made you;
second, your neighbour as yourself; and everything that you
would not have done to you, do not do to another.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Now the teaching of these words is this: Bless those that
curse you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for those that persecute
you; for what merit is there if you love those that love
you? Do not even the heathen do that? But love those that hate
you, and you will have no enemy.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>Abstain from physical and bodily cravings. If someone strikes
you on the right cheek, turn the other to him too, and you will be
perfect. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go two miles with
him. If anyone takes away your coat, give him your shirt too.
If anyone takes from you what is yours, do not demand it back,
for you cannot.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>Give to everyone that asks of you, and do not demand it back.
For the Father wishes that from his own gifts it should be given
to all. Blessed is he who gives according to the command, for
he is innocent. Woe to him who receives; for if a man receives
because he is in need, he will be innocent; but he who receives
<span class="pb" id="page_12"><b class="pb">{Page 12}</b></span>
when he is not in need will stand trial, as to why he received
and for what, and being put in prison he will be examined about
what he has done, and he will not come out of it until he pays
the last penny. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But of this it was also said, “Let your charity
sweat in your hands until you know to whom to give.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>The second command of the Teaching is: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You shall not murder,
you shall not commit adultery, you shall not corrupt boys, you
shall not commit fornication, you shall not steal, you shall not
practise magic, you shall not use enchantments, you shall not
murder a child by abortion, or kill one when born. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You shall not
desire your neighbour’s goods, you shall not commit perjury, you
shall not bear false witness, you shall not speak evil, you shall
not hold a grudge. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>You shall not be double-minded, nor double-tongued,
for the double tongue is a deadly snare. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Your speech
shall not be false or vain, but fulfilled in action. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>You shall not be
covetous or rapacious, or a hypocrite or malicious or proud. You
shall not entertain an evil design against your neighbour. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You
shall not hate any man, but some you shall reprove, and for
some you shall pray, and some you shall love more than your
life.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>My child, flee from everyone evil, and from everyone like him.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Do not be irascible, for anger leads to murder, or jealous, or
contentious or passionate; for all these things breed murders.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>My child, do not be lustful, for lust leads to fornication, or foul-spoken
or one who lifts up his eyes; for all these things breed
adulteries.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>My child, do not be a dealer in omens, since it leads to idolatry,
or an enchanter, or an astrologer, or a magician, and do not
wish to see or hear them, for all these things breed idolatry.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>My child, do not be a liar, since lying leads to theft, or avaricious,
or vainglorious, for all these things breed thefts.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>My child, do not be a grumbler, since it leads to blasphemy,
or self-willed or evil-minded, for all these things breed blasphemies;
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>but be meek, since the meek will inherit the earth. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Be long-suffering
<span class="pb" id="page_13"><b class="pb">{Page 13}</b></span>
and merciful and guileless, and quiet and good, and
always revere the words that you have heard. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>You shall not exalt
yourself, or admit arrogance to your soul. Your soul shall not
associate with lofty men, but you shall live with upright and
humble men. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>You shall accept the experiences that befall you as
good, knowing that nothing happens without God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>My child, night and day you shall remember him who speaks
the word of God to you, and you shall honour him as the Lord,
for where the Lord’s nature is talked of, there the Lord is. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And
you shall seek daily the faces of the saints, to find rest in their
words. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You shall not cause division, but you shall reconcile
fighters. You shall judge uprightly, you shall not show partiality
in reproving transgressions. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>You shall not doubt whether it will
be or not.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>Do not be stretching out your hands to take, and closing them
when it comes to giving. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>If you have earned it through your
hands, you shall give a ransom for your sins. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You shall not
hesitate to give, nor grumble when you give, for you shall know
who is the good payer of wages. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>You shall not turn the needy
away, but you shall share everything with your brother, and
you shall not say it is your own. For if you share in what is immortal,
how much more in mortal things!</p>

<p><sup class="verse">9 </sup>You shall not withhold your hand from your son or from your
daughter, but from their youth up you shall teach them the
fear of God. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>You shall not give orders in bitterness to your man
or woman slave, who hope in the same God, lest they cease to
fear the God who is over you both; for he came not to call men
with partiality, but those whom the Spirit prepared. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>And you
slaves shall obey your masters, as a symbol of God, with modesty
and fear. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>You shall hate all hypocrisy, and everything that is
not pleasing to the Lord.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">13 </sup>You must not forsake the commandments of the Lord, but you
shall keep the teachings you have received, neither adding to
them nor taking from them. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>In church you shall confess your
<span class="pb" id="page_14"><b class="pb">{Page 14}</b></span>
transgressions, and you shall not approach prayer with an evil
conscience. This is the way of life.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>But the way of death is this: First of all, it is wicked and
full of cursing; murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts,
idolatries, magic arts, enchantments, robberies, false witnessings,
hypocrisies, duplicity, fraud, pride, malice, willfulness, covetousness,
foul speech, jealousy, arrogance, exaltation, boastfulness.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Persecutors of good men, hating truth, loving falsehood, ignorant
of the wages of uprightness, not adhering to what is good, nor
to upright judgment, lying awake not for what is good but for
what is evil, from whom gentleness and patience are far away,
loving vanity, seeking reward, without pity for the poor, not toiling
for the oppressed, ignoring their Maker, murderers of children,
corrupters of God’s creatures, turning away the needy,
oppressing the afflicted, advocates of the rich, unjust judges of
the poor, utterly sinful. May you be delivered, my children, from
all these!</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>See that no one leads you astray from this way of the Teaching,
for he teaches you without God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if you can bear the
whole yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you cannot, do
what you can.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>About food, hear what you can, but abstain strictly from what
is offered to idols, for it is a worship of dead gods.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>About baptism, baptize in this way: After first repeating all
these things, baptize in running water, in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the holy Spirit. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>If you have no running
water, baptize in other water, and if you cannot use cold water,
use warm. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>If you have neither, pour water on the head three
times, in the name of Father and Son and holy Spirit. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And before
the baptism let the baptizer and the one who is to be baptized
and any others who can do so fast. And you must order the one
who is to be baptized to fast one or two days beforehand.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>Your fasts must not be on the same days with the hypocrites,
for they fast on Monday and Thursday, but you must fast on
<span class="pb" id="page_15"><b class="pb">{Page 15}</b></span>
Wednesday and Friday. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And do not pray like the hypocrites,
but pray thus as the Lord commanded in his gospel:</p>

<p>“Our Father in heaven, your name be revered, your kingdom
come, your will be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Give
us today our bread for the day, and forgive us our debt, as we
forgive our debtors; and do not subject us to temptation, but,
save us from the Evil One; for yours is the power and the glory
forever!”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Three times a day pray thus.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>Now about the Thanksgiving, give thanks thus: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>First about
the cup, “We thank you, our Father, for the holy vine of your
servant David, which you have made known to us through your
servant Jesus. Glory to you forever.” <b class="chapter">3 </b>And about the piece of
bread, “We thank you, our Father, for the life and knowledge
you have made known to us through Jesus your servant. Glory
be yours forever. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Just as this piece of bread was scattered over
the mountains, and then was gathered together and became one,
so let your church be gathered together from the ends of the
earth into your kingdom. For the glory and the power are yours
through Jesus Christ forever.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But let no one eat or drink of your
Thanksgiving but those who have been baptized in the name
of the Lord. For it was of this that the Lord said, “Do not give
dogs what is sacred.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>After you are satisfied, give thanks thus: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>“We give you thanks,
Holy Father, for your holy name, which you have made dwell
in our hearts, and for knowledge and faith and immortality, which
you have made known to us through Jesus your servant; glory to
you forever. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You, almighty Master, have created all things for
your name’s sake, you have given men food and drink to enjoy,
that they may give you thanks, but you have granted us spiritual
food and drink and everlasting life through you servant. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Above
all we thank you that you are mighty; glory to you forever.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>Remember, Lord, your church, to save it from all evil and to
make it perfect in your love, and gather it together in its holiness
<span class="pb" id="page_16"><b class="pb">{Page 16}</b></span>
from the four winds, into your kingdom which you have prepared
for it. For the power and the glory are yours forever.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>Let your favour come and this world pass away. Hosanna to the
God of David! If anyone is holy, let him come; if anyone is not,
let him repent. Lord, come quickly! Amen.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But permit the
prophets to give thanks as much as they please.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>Whoever comes and teaches you all these things said above,
you must welcome. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But if the teacher himself turns away and
teaches another doctrine, to destroy them, do not listen to him.
But if his teaching is for the promotion of uprightness and the
knowledge of the Lord, welcome him as you would the Lord.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>About apostles and prophets, follow the rule of the Gospel,
which is this: <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Let every apostle who comes to you be welcomed
as the Lord. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But he shall not stay more than one day, and if it is
necessary, the next day also. But if he stays three days, he is a
false prophet. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And when an apostle leaves, let him take nothing
except bread to last until he finds his next lodging. But if he
asks for money, he is a false prophet.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>You shall not test or examine any prophet who speaks in the
spirit. For every sin will be forgiven, but this sin will not be forgiven.
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>But not everyone who speaks in the spirit is a prophet,
but only if he has the ways of the Lord. So the false prophet and
the prophet will be known by their ways. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>No prophet who orders
a meal under the spirit’s influence shall eat of it; if he does, he is
a false prophet. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>Every prophet who teaches the truth, if he
does not do what he teaches, is a false prophet. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>No prophet, tried
and true, who does anything as an earthly symbol of the church,
but does not teach others to do what he does, shall be judged
among you, for he has his judgment with God, for the ancient
prophets also did this. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>But whoever says in the spirit, “Give me
money,” or something else, you shall not listen to him, but if he
tells you to give for others who are in want, let no one judge
him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>Let everyone who comes in the name of the Lord be welcomed,
<span class="pb" id="page_17"><b class="pb">{Page 17}</b></span>
and afterward when you have tested him you will know him, for
you will have understanding of true and false. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>If the one who
comes is a traveller, help him all you can. But he must not stay
with you more than two or if necessary three days. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>If he wants
to settle among you and has a trade, let him work for his living.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>But if he has no trade, see to it in your understanding that no
one lives among you in idleness because he is a Christian. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>If he
will not do this, he is trading on Christ. Beware of such men.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>But every true prophet who wants to settle among you deserves
his food. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>In like manner, a true teacher, like the workman, deserves
his food. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So you shall take the first fruits of the produce
of the wine press and the threshing floor and of cattle and sheep
and give the first fruits to the prophets, for they are your high
priests. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But if you have no prophet, give it to the poor. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>If you
make bread, take the first fruits and give them according to the
command. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>In like manner, when you open a jar of wine or oil,
take the first fruits and give them to the prophets. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And of
money and clothing and everything you get, take the first fruits,
as you think best, and give, according to the command.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>On the Lord’s own day, gather together and break bread and
give thanks, after confessing your transgressions, so that your
sacrifice may be pure. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let no one who has a quarrel with his
comrade meet with you until they are reconciled, so that your
sacrifice may not be defiled. <b class="chapter">3 </b>For this is what was said by the
Lord, “At every place and time offer me a clean sacrifice, for I
am a great king, says the Lord, and my name is wonderful among
the heathen.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>So appoint for yourselves overseers and assistants worthy of
the Lord, men who are humble-minded and not avaricious, but
are true and tried, for they themselves also render you the service
of the prophets and teachers. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So do not despise them, for they
are your honourable men along with the prophets and teachers.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Do not reprove one another in wrath, but in peace as you find
it in the gospel. If anyone wrongs his neighbour, let no one speak
<span class="pb" id="page_18"><b class="pb">{Page 18}</b></span>
to him, and let him not hear a word from you until he repents.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>And offer your prayers and do your alms and all your acts as you
find it in the Gospel of our Lord.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>Be watchful for your life; your lamps must not go out, and
you must not be unprepared, but be ready, for you do not know
the hour when our Lord is coming. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Gather together often to
seek the things that benefit your souls, for the whole time of your
faith will not profit you unless you are found perfect at the last
time. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For in the last days the false prophets and the corrupters
will be multiplied, and the sheep will be turned into wolves and
love will be turned into hate, <sup class="verse">4 </sup>for as lawlessness increases, they
will hate and persecute and betray one another, and then the
world-deceiver will appear as a son of God, and will do signs
and wonders, and the earth will be delivered into his hands,
and he will commit lawless acts which have never been since
the beginning. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Then created mankind will pass into the fiery
trial and many will fall away and perish, but those who endure
in their faith will be saved by the curse itself. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then will appear
the signs of the truth, first, the sign of the opening in the heaven,
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>then the sign of the sound of the trumpet, and third, the resurrection
of the dead, but not of all, but as it was said, “The Lord
will come and all his saints with him.” <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Then the world will see
the Lord coming on the clouds of the sky.</p>

<h2>The Letter of Barnabas</h2>

<p>From the beginning, the Old Testament was a problem for
Christian believers. As early as A.D. 52 Paul had touched upon
it in Galatians, and a hundred years later Marcion was rejecting
the Old Testament, while Justin was accepting it. But even in
the time of Paul one Jewish scholar, Philo, at Alexandria, had
allegorized it, very much as the Stoics had so successfully allegorized
Homer, until they had made it, as some say, the Bible of
the Greeks. Before the end of the first century allegory had been
adopted as a Christian approach to the Old Testament in the
Letter to the Hebrews, and a generation later, about A.D. 130, a
Christian teacher, perhaps at Alexandria, and certainly in the
Alexandrian tradition, applied it boldly to the Law, the Prophets,
and the Psalms, in the earliest form of the Letter of Barnabas.
He takes the position that the Jews’ literal understanding of their
Law was the work of a wicked angel, who deceived them. The six
days of creation are really the six thousand years the earth is to
endure before the return of the Messiah, and the food laws of
Leviticus only mean that we are not to be like swine or birds of
prey.</p>

<p>The reference to the building of a temple in Jerusalem by the
heathen seems to reflect Hadrian’s building of a temple to Jupiter
there in A.D. 130-131, and the mention of the ten kings, in chapter
4, would also bring us to the time of Hadrian, if the writer
<span class="pb" id="page_20"><b class="pb">{Page 20}</b></span>
reckoned emperors as the Revelation did, omitting Galba, Otho,
and Vitellius.</p>

<p>In its original form, the letter probably stopped with chapter
17, as the Latin manuscript found at St. Petersburg does, for at
the end of it the form and interest change completely, and with
the crudest possible transition: “So much for that. Now let us
pass to another lesson and teaching” (“Gnosis and Didache”). The
Greek form of the Letter then continues with more than fifty
brief commands from the primitive form of The <i>Teaching of the
Apostles</i> (Doctrina), twenty-three positive and twenty-eight
negative. Much of what Barnabas omits in its use of Doctrina
is covered elsewhere in Barnabas, chapters 17-21, so that its use
of Doctrina is not inferior to Didache’s use of it; it is in fact superior
to it. Moreover, Barnabas presents its moral code less as vices
to be shunned than as virtues to be sought, a far superior method.
This expansion was probably made between A.D. 150 and 175.</p>

<p>It is striking that the two component parts of Barnabas have
come down to us in Latin versions, not in their Greek originals,
though these may sometime be found. The manuscripts of the
full Greek Barnabas have an interesting history. For a long time
it was known to modern learning only in a group of eight manuscripts
all derived from one which had lost several leaves, and
so their contents skipped from Polycarp to the Philippians 9.2 to
Barnabas 5.7. But when Tischendorf in 1859 found the Codex
Sinaiticus in the convent of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, he
observed the full Greek text of Barnabas in it, immediately after
the Revelation, and sat up all that night to copy what he knew
would be a great treasure of early Christian literature. Later, in
1873, Bryennius found it again in the Constantinople manuscript
of A.D. 1056, which contained the Didache. It is upon these two
manuscripts that our knowledge of the Greek Barnabas principally
rests.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_21"><b class="pb">{Page 21}</b></span></p>

<p>The appearance of Barnabas immediately following the Revelation
and followed by Hermas in the oldest complete Greek manuscript
of the New Testament shows the regard in which it was
held in Christian Egypt in the middle of the fourth century.
Clement of Alexandria, toward the end of the second century,
accepted it as scripture, and commented on it in his lost <i>Outlines</i>.
Origen too included it among the disputed books that he accepted
as scripture. Jerome speaks of it as read among the apocryphal
writings. The list in the Codex Claromontanus, representing
Christian usage in Egypt about A.D. 300, has it at the end of the
General Letters, between Jade and the Revelation of John.
Eusebius classes it as disputed and rejected. The <i>List of the Sixty
Canonical Books</i> (before A.D. 800) puts it among the rejected
books, and the <i>Stichometry of Nicephorus</i>, about A.D. 850, classes
it with the disputed books—the Revelation of John, the Revelation
of Peter, and the Gospel of the Hebrews—but not among the
rejected ones.</p>

<h2>The Letter of Barnabas</h2>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Greeting, sons and daughters, in the name of the Lord who
has loved us, in peace.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>Great and rich as the ordinances of God are toward you, I
rejoice extremely and exceedingly over your blessed and glorious
spirits, so congenially have you received the favour of the gift of
the spirit. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Therefore I congratulate myself the more in my hope
of being saved, because in you I really see that the spirit has
been poured out upon you from the rich Lord of the fountain.
So much has my longed-for sight of you amazed me about you.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>So being convinced of this and conscious that since I spoke to
you I have come to know many things, because the Lord has
journeyed with me in the way of uprightness, I am absolutely
forced to this, to love you above my own soul, because great faith
and love dwell in you, in the hope of his life. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So since I have
decided that if I am concerned about you to share with you some
part of what I have received, I will be rewarded for having been
of service to such spirits, I have been eager to send you a short
letter, so that you may have your knowledge keep pace with your
faith.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>There are three rules of the Lord: the hope of life is the
beginning and end of our faith; uprightness is the beginning and
end of judgment; love of joy and gladness is the proof of acts
of uprightness. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For the Master has made the past and present
known to us through the prophets, giving us also the first fruits of
the taste of the future. When we see these things coming to pass
<span class="pb" id="page_24"><b class="pb">{Page 24}</b></span>
one after another, as he said, we ought to make a richer and
loftier offering to his fear. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>And not as a teacher but as one of
you I will show you a few things over which you will rejoice
in the present time.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>Since the days are evil, and the Worker himself is in power,
we ought to take heed to ourselves, and seek out the Lord’s
ordinances. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Fear and endurance therefore are the helpers of
our faith, and our allies are patience and self-control. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So as long
as these abide in purity in relation to the Lord, wisdom, intelligence,
understanding, and knowledge rejoice with them. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For
he has made it plain to us through all the prophets that he needs
neither sacrifices nor burnt offerings nor offerings, for he somewhere
says, <sup class="verse">5 </sup>“What is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? says
the Lord. I am full of burnt offerings, and I do not want the fat
of lambs and the blood of bulls and goats, not even if you come
to be seen by me. For who has required this at your hands? You
shall not tread my courts again. If you bring fine flour, it is vain.
Incense is an abomination to me; your new moons and sabbaths
I cannot bear.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So he abolished these things in order that the new
law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is free from the yoke of
necessity, might have its offering not made by man. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Again he
says to them, “Did I command your forefathers, when they came
out of the land of Egypt, to offer burnt offerings and sacrifices to
me? <sup class="verse">8 </sup>No, this is what I commanded them: “Let none of you bear
a grudge in his heart against his neighbour; and do not love a
false oath.” <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So we ought to perceive, if we are not without understanding,
the benevolent purpose of our Father, for he speaks
to us, because he does not wish us to go astray like them, but to
seek how to make our offering to him. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>This then is what he says
to us: “A broken heart is a sacrifice to the Lord; a heart that
glorifies its maker is a fragrant odour to the Lord.” So, brethren,
we ought to inquire closely about our salvation, so that the Evil
One may not smuggle some error in among us and dislodge us
from our life.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_25"><b class="pb">{Page 25}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>So he says to them again about this, “Why do you fast to me,
says the Lord, so that your voice is raised in a cry to me? This
is not the fast that I have chosen, says the Lord, not a man
humbling his soul, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>not even if you bend your neck like a ring,
and put on sackcloth and lie in ashes, not even so can you call it
an acceptable fast.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But to us he says, “Behold, this is the fast
I have chosen, says the Lord: Undo every unrighteous bond, untie
the knots of violent agreements, set the bruised at liberty, and
tear up every unfair contract. Break your bread to the hungry,
and if you see a man naked, clothe him. Take the homeless into
your house, and if you see a humble person, you shall not look
down on him, nor shall the members of your household. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Then
your light will break forth early in the morning and your healing
will rise quickly, and your uprightness will go before you and
the glory of the Lord will envelop you. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Then you will cry out
and God will hear you; while you are still speaking, he will say,
Here I am! if you strip from you every fetter and lifting up of the
hand, and grumbling word, and give your bread to the hungry
from your heart, and show pity to the soul that is oppressed.”
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>So, brethren, he that is long suffering, foreseeing that the people
he had prepared in his Beloved would believe in guilelessness,
made all plain to us beforehand, so that we might not suffer
shipwreck by being converted to their law.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>We must therefore examine closely the things of the present
and seek out the things that can save us. So let us flee absolutely
from all lawless doings, so that lawless doings may not overtake
us, and let us hate the error of the present time, so that we may
be loved in the time that is to come. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let us give our souls no
liberty to have power to associate with sinners and evil men, so
that we may not become like them. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The final stumbling block
is at hand, of which it is written, as Enoch says, “For this is why
the Lord has cut the times and the days short, in order that
his Beloved may make haste and come to his inheritance.”
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>And thus says the prophet also: “Ten reigns shall reign over the
<span class="pb" id="page_26"><b class="pb">{Page 26}</b></span>
earth, and after them will rise a little king who will subdue three
of the kings under one.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Similarly of the same one Daniel says,
“And I saw the fourth beast, which was evil and strong and
fiercer than all the beasts of the sea, and that ten horns sprang
from it, and out of them sprang a little horn, an excrescence, and
that it subdued three of the large horns under one.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>You ought
therefore to understand. And besides I ask this also of you, as
one of your own number, and especially as loving you all more
than my own life, that you now take heed to yourselves and be
not like some, piling up your sins and saying that the covenant
is theirs as well as ours. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>It is ours, but they lost it completely
just after Moses received it, in the following manner. For the
scripture says, “Now Moses was on the mountain fasting forty
days and forty nights, and he received the covenant from the
Lord, stone tablets written upon with the finger of the Lord’s
hand.” <sup class="verse">8 </sup>But they turned to idols and lost it, for thus says the
Lord: “Moses, Moses, go down quickly, for your people whom
you have led out of the land of Egypt have broken the Law.”
And Moses understood and he threw the two tablets from his
hands and their covenant was broken in pieces, in order that the
covenant of the beloved Jesus might be sealed on our hearts in
the hope of his faith.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">9 </sup>Though I would like to write much, not as a teacher but as
one who loves to leave out nothing of what we have. I hasten to
write—I, your humble sacrifice. Therefore let us take heed in the
last days, for the whole time of our life and faith will do us no
good unless we now in this lawless time withstand also the
offences that are to come, as befits sons of God. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>In order therefore
that the Black One may have no chance to enter, let us
flee from all vanity, let us absolutely hate the doings of the evil
way. Do not withdraw by yourselves and live alone, as though
you had already become upright, but gather together, and
seek out the common advantage. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>For the scripture says, “Alas for
those that are wise in their own eyes, and understanding in
<span class="pb" id="page_27"><b class="pb">{Page 27}</b></span>
their own sight.” Let us be spiritual, let us be a perfect temple
for God, as far as it is in our power. Let us practise the fear of
God and strive to keep his commandments, so that we may
delight in his ordinances. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>The Lord will judge the world impartially;
each one will receive according to what he has done. If he
is good his uprightness will precede him, if he is bad, the wages
of evildoing awaits him. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>Let us never, because we are called,
rest in that, and fall asleep over our sins, and so the evil ruler
will get control of us and thrust us out of the kingdom of the
Lord. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>Consider this too besides, my brethren: when you see that
after such signs and wonders were done in Israel, even then they
were abandoned, let us take care that we are not found as it is
written, “many invited, but few chosen.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>For it was for this that the Lord endured giving up his flesh to
corruption, that we might be purified by the forgiveness of our
sins, that is, through sprinkling with his blood. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For what is written
about him has to do partly with Israel, partly with us. And
this is what it says: “He was wounded because of our transgressions,
and bruised because of our sins. By his stripes we were
healed. He was led like a sheep to slaughter, and he was dumb
like a lamb before its shearer.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>We ought certainly to give thanks
exceedingly to the Lord because he has made known to us the
past, and made us wise about the present, and about the future
we are not without understanding. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For the scripture says, “Not
unjustly are nets spread for birds.” This means that a man will
justly perish who when he knows the way of uprightness keeps
to the way of darkness. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>There is this, too, my brethren. If the
Lord endured it to suffer for our life, though he was Lord of all
the world, to whom God said, at the foundation of the world,
“Let us make man in our image and our likeness,” then how
did he endure it, to suffer at the hands of men? Learn then!
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>The prophets being favoured by him prophesied about him, and
he, in order to bring death to naught, and show the resurrection
from the dead, because he had to be revealed in flesh, endured
<span class="pb" id="page_28"><b class="pb">{Page 28}</b></span>
it, <sup class="verse">7 </sup>so as to fulfil the promises made to the forefathers and himself
prepare the new people for himself, and show while still on earth
that he himself when he has effected the resurrection will be
a judge. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Finally, he preached, teaching Israel and doing such
signs and wonders, and loved them intensely. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And when he chose
his own apostles who were going to preach his gospel, though
they were indescribably lawless, to show that he had not come
to call the upright but the irreligious, he showed himself to be
the Son of God. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>For if he had not come in flesh, how could
men have looked at him and been saved, when as they look at
the sun, which is destined not to be, which is the work of his
hands, they cannot gaze at its rays? <sup class="verse">11 </sup>So the Son of God came in
flesh for this purpose, that he might fill out the total of the sins
of those who had driven his prophets to death. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>So it was for
that purpose that he endured. For God says that the wounding
of his flesh was from them: “When they strike down their own
shepherd, the sheep of the flock will perish.” <sup class="verse">13 </sup>And he himself
chose to suffer thus, for it was necessary that he should suffer on
a tree, for he that prophesied said of him, “Spare my soul from
the sword,” and “Nail my flesh, for assemblies of evildoers have
risen up against me.” <sup class="verse">14 </sup>And again he says, “Behold, I have offered
my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows, and I have set
my face like a solid rock.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>When therefore he made the command, what did he say?
“Who is he that goes to law with me? Let him oppose me. Or
who is he that seeks vindication against me? Let him approach
the Lord’s servant. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Alas for you! For you will grow old like a
cloak, and a moth will devour you.” And again the prophet says,
since he was put in place like a mighty stone to crush them,
“Here I lay a choice stone in the foundations of Zion, a costly,
valued cornerstone.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>What does he say next? “And whoever
believes in it will live for ever.” Does our hope then rest on a
stone? Not at all, but because the Lord has set his flesh in
strength. For he says, “and he has set me like a solid rock.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And
<span class="pb" id="page_29"><b class="pb">{Page 29}</b></span>
again the prophet says, “The stone that the builders refused has
become the cornerstone.” And again he says, “This is the great,
wonderful day that the Lord made.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>I am writing to you very
simply, so that you can understand—I, a humble sacrifice of
your love. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then what does the prophet say again? “A gathering
of evildoers has encircled me; they surrounded me like bees
around the honey,” and “for my clothing they cast lots.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Then,
since he was to appear and suffer in flesh, his suffering was predicted.
For the prophet says of Israel, “Alas for their soul, for
they have formed an evil design against themselves, saying, ‘Let
us bind the upright man, for he inconveniences us.’” <sup class="verse">8 </sup>What does
that other prophet Moses say to them? “Behold thus says the
Lord God: ‘Go into the good land, which the Lord swore to
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and take possession of it, a land
flowing with milk and honey.’” <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And learn what knowledge
says. Hope, it says, in Jesus, who is to be manifested to you in
flesh. For man is earth capable of suffering, for the formation of
Adam was from the face of the earth. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>What then does “into the
good land, a land flowing with milk and honey” mean? Blessed
be our Lord, brethren, who put in us wisdom and understanding
of his secrets. For the prophet is uttering a parable of
the Lord; who can understand it but one that is wise and understanding
and loves his Lord? <sup class="verse">11 </sup>So since he has renewed us by the
forgiveness of sins, he has made us another type, so that we
should have the souls of children, as though he were creating us
anew. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>For the scripture is speaking of us, when he says to the
Son, “Let us make man in our image and likeness, and let them
rule the wild animals of the earth, and the birds of the heaven
and the fish of the sea.” And when the Lord saw our goodly
form, he said, “Increase and multiply and fill the earth”—addressing
the Son.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">13 </sup>Again I will show you how he refers to us. At last he has
made a second creation. And the Lord says, “Behold, I am making
the last things like the first.” So it was with a view to this
that the prophet declared, “Go into a land flowing with milk
<span class="pb" id="page_30"><b class="pb">{Page 30}</b></span>
and honey, and take possession of it.” <sup class="verse">14 </sup>Notice then, we have been
created anew, as he says again in another prophet, “Behold,
says the Lord, I will take out of them,” that is, of those whom
the spirit of the Lord foresaw, “their hearts of stone, and put in
them hearts of flesh,” because he was going to be manifested in
flesh and to live among us. <sup class="verse">15 </sup>For the habitation of our hearts,
my brethren, is a temple, holy to the Lord. <sup class="verse">16 </sup>For the Lord says
again, “And with what shall I appear to the Lord my God, and
be glorified?” He says, “I will confess you in the assembly of
my brethren, and sing to you in the midst of the assembly of
saints.” So it is we that he brought into the good land. <sup class="verse">17 </sup>Then why
the milk and the honey? Because a child is fed with honey first,
then with milk. So we too are fed with faith in the promise and
with the word and will live and take possession of the earth.
<sup class="verse">18 </sup>For he said before, “And let them increase and multiply and rule
the fish.” Who, then, can rule wild beasts or fish or birds of the
heaven? For we ought to perceive that to rule implies authority,
so that one gives orders and is obeyed. <sup class="verse">19 </sup>So if this is not now the
case, then he has told us when it will be; when we ourselves are
perfected to become heirs of the Lord’s covenant.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>Observe, therefore, children of gladness, that the good Lord has
revealed all these things to us beforehand so that we may know
to whom we ought to give thanks and praise for everything.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>So if the Son of God, though he was Lord, and was to judge the
living and the dead, suffered in order that his wounds might
bring us life, let us believe that the Son of God could not
suffer except for us. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But when he was crucified he was given
vinegar and gall to drink. Hear how the priests in the temple
revealed this. When the command was written, “Whoever does
not keep the fast shall be put to death,” the Lord commanded it
because he himself was going to offer the vessel of the spirit
as a sacrifice for our sins, in order that the pattern set up in the
case of Isaac, who was offered upon the altar, might be fulfilled.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>What then does he say in the prophet? “And let them eat
<span class="pb" id="page_31"><b class="pb">{Page 31}</b></span>
of the goat that is offered at the fast for their sin.” Give close
heed! “And let all the priests but no others eat the entrails
unwashed, but with vinegar.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Why? Because you are going to
offer me gall with vinegar to drink when I am about to offer
my flesh for the sins of my new people, you alone must eat,
while the people fast and lament in sackcloth and ashes—to
show that he must suffer at their hands. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Observe what he commanded:
“Take two fine, well-matched goats, and offer them,
and let the priest take one for a burnt offering for sins.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But
what shall they do with the other? The other, he says, is accursed.
Notice how the type of Jesus is revealed. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>“And spit upon it all of
you and prick it, and tie scarlet wool on its head, and in that
condition let it be thrown into the desert.” And when this is done
the man that has charge of the goat leads it into the desert and
takes oil the wool and puts it on the bush called rache, the
shoots of which we are accustomed to eat when we find them in
the country; only the fruit of the rache is sweet, in this way.
Then what does this mean? <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Notice, “one for the altar, and the
other accursed,” and why the one that is accursed, crowned?
Because then, on that day, they will see him with the scarlet robe
about his body, reaching to his feet, and they will say, “Is
not this he whom we once crucified, setting him at naught and
piercing him and spitting upon him? It was certainly this man
who said then that he was Son of God.” <sup class="verse">10 </sup>For how is he like it?
For this reason: “The goats alike, fine, well matched,” in order
that when they see him come then, they may be amazed at the
likeness of the goat. Behold therefore the type of Jesus who was
to suffer. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>But what does it mean that they put the wool in the
midst of the thorns? It is a type of Jesus set before the church,
because whoever wishes to take away the scarlet wool must
suffer much, because the thorn is terrible, and he can only get
possession of it through pain. So, he says, “those who wish to
see me and touch my kingdom must go through affliction and
suffering to get me.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_32"><b class="pb">{Page 32}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>But what do you think it typifies, that Israel was commanded
that the men whose sins were full grown should offer a heifer,
and slaughter it and burn it, and then boys should take the
ashes and put them into bowls, and tie scarlet wool on a stick
of wood (notice again the type of the cross and the scarlet wool)
and take hyssop, and then the boys should sprinkle the people
one by one, so that they may be purified from their sins? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Notice
how plainly he is speaking to you. The calf is Jesus, the sinful
men who offer it are those who brought him to be slain. Then
they are no longer mere men, the glory no longer belongs to
sinners. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The boys who sprinkled are those who preached to us the
forgiveness of sins and the purification of the heart. To them—they
were twelve in number, as a testimony to the tribes, for
there are twelve tribes of Israel—he gave authority to preach the
gospel. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But why are there three boys that sprinkle? To testify
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for they were great in the sight of
God. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And why was the wool placed on the stick of wood?
Because the reign of Jesus rests upon wood, and those who hope
in him will live forever. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And why the wool and the hyssop
together? Because in his reign there will be evil and corrupt
days, in which we will be saved, because he who suffers in body
is cured through the juice of the hyssop. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And that they happened
for this reason is evident to us, but obscure to them, because they
have not listened to the voice of the Lord.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>For he speaks further about the ears, how he has circumcised
our hearts. The Lord says in the prophet, “At the hearing of the
ear, they obey me,” and again he says, “Those who are far off
will surely hear, they will know what I have done.” And “Circumcise
your hearts, says the Lord.” <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And again he says, “Listen,
Israel, for thus says the Lord your God.” And again the spirit of
the Lord prophesies, “Who is there that wishes to live forever?
Let him be sure to listen to the voice of my servant.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And
again he says, “Listen, heaven, and give ear, earth, for the Lord
has spoken.” These things are to prove it. And again he says,
<span class="pb" id="page_33"><b class="pb">{Page 33}</b></span>
“Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of this people.” And
again he says, “Hear, children, the voice of one who is shouting
in the desert.” So he has circumcised our ears, so that we may
hear the word and believe. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Besides, the circumcision in which
they trusted has been abolished, for he has commanded that
there should be a circumcision not of the flesh, but they disobeyed,
for an evil angel deluded them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>He says to them, “Thus
says the Lord your God” (here I find a command), “Do not
sow among thorns, be circumcised to your Lord.” And what
does he say? “Circumcise your hardheartedness, and do not be
stiff-necked.” Take another: “Behold, says the Lord, all the
heathen are uncircumcised in flesh, but this people is uncircumcised
in heart.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But, you will say, surely the people were circumcised
for a seal. But so is every Syrian and Arab and all the
priests of the idols. Do these also, then, share in their covenant?
Why, even the Egyptians practise circumcision! <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Learn, therefore,
dear children, richly about everything, for Abraham, who
first imparted circumcision, did so looking forward in spirit to
Jesus, for he received instruction in three letters. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>For it says,
“And of his household Abraham circumcised eighteen and three
hundred men.” What, then, was the knowledge given him? Notice
that he mentions the eighteen first, and after a space the three
hundred. The eighteen is I, ten, and H, eight; you have (the
abbreviation for) Jesus! And because the cross was going to express
God’s favor in the T, he says also “three hundred.” So he
discloses Jesus by the two letters and the cross by the other.
<sup class="verse">9 </sup>He who has planted the gift of his teaching in us knows this.
No one has ever learned from me a sounder lesson, but I know
that you are worthy of it.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Now, because Moses said, “You shall not eat swine or eagle
or hawk or crow or any fish that does not have scales on it,”
he had three teachings in mind. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Further, he says to them in
Deuteronomy, “And I will set forth my ordinances to this people.”
So, then, God’s command is not that they should not eat, but
<span class="pb" id="page_34"><b class="pb">{Page 34}</b></span>
Moses spoke in the spirit. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>This, then, is why he mentioned the
swine: “You shall not associate,” he means, “with men who are
like swine,” that is, when they are in luxury, they forget the
Lord, but when they are in want they acknowledge the Lord,
just as the swine when it is feeding does not know its master,
but when it is hungry it squeals, and when it has been fed,
it is quiet again. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Neither shall you eat the eagle or the hawk
Or the kite or the crow”; you shall not, he means, associate with
or come to resemble such men as do not know how to provide
their food by toil and sweat, but lawlessly seize what belongs
to others, and while pretending to live in innocence, watch and
look about to find whom they can plunder in their greed, just as
these birds are the only ones that provide no food for themselves,
but sit idle and seek ways to eat the meat of others, since they
are pests in wickedness. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>“And you shall not eat,” he goes on,
“sea eel or polyp or cuttlefish.” You shall not, he means, associate
with such men and come to resemble them, who are utterly
ungodly and already condemned to death, just as these fish alone
are accursed and swim in the depths, not swimming on the surface
like the rest, but living in the mud at the bottom. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Moreover,
you shall not eat the hare. Why? You shall not, he means, be
a corrupter of boys or come to resemble such men, for the hare
gains a passage in the body every year, for it has as many
openings as it is years old. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But do not eat the hyena either;
you shall not, he means, become an adulterer or a corrupter of
boys or come to resemble such men. Why? Because this animal
changes its nature from year to year and becomes now male, now
female. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>But he did well to abhor the weasel, too. You shall not,
he means, be like those men who, we hear, commit iniquity with
their mouths for the sake of uncleanness, and you shall not
associate with unclean women who commit iniquity with their
mouths. For this animal conceives with its mouth. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Moses received
three decrees about food and uttered them in the spirit,
but they in their fleshly desire received them as having to do
<span class="pb" id="page_35"><b class="pb">{Page 35}</b></span>
with eating. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>But David understands the meaning of these three
decrees, and says, “Blessed is the man who has not gone in the
counsel of the ungodly”—as the fish go in darkness to the bottom;
“and has not stood in the pathway of sinners”—as those
who claim to fear the Lord but sin like the swine; “and has not
sat on the seat of the pestilent,” like birds that sit and wait for
their prey. You have in full the lesson about eating. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>Again Moses
says, “Eat anything that has cloven boots and chews the cud.”
What does he mean? That when it is fed it knows who feeds it
and, relying on him, seems to be glad. Well did he speak, regarding
the command. What, then, does he mean? Associate with
those who fear the Lord, with those who meditate in their
hearts on the command they have received, with those who talk
of the things ordained by the Lord and observe them, with those
who know that meditation is a work of gladness and ruminate
on the word of the Lord. But why does he speak of the cloven
hoofed? The upright man both lives in this world and looks forward
to the holy age. See how well Moses made laws. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>But
how could they understand or grasp these things? But we, having
an upright understanding of his commands utter them as the
Lord intended. This is why he has circumcised our ears and
hearts so that we may grasp these things.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>But let us inquire whether the Lord took care to foreshadow
the water and the cross. About the water it is written of Israel
how they would not accept the baptism that brings forgiveness of
sins, but would build for themselves. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the prophet says, “Be
astonished, heaven, and let the earth shudder the more at this,
because this people has done two evil things, they have forsaken
me, the spring of life, and have dug themselves a pit of death. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Is
my holy mount Sinai a desert rock? For you will be like a bird’s
nestlings, fluttering about when they are taken away from their
nest.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And again the prophet says, “I will go before you and level
mountains and shatter gates of brass and break iron bars, and I
will give you treasures of darkness, hidden, unseen, so that they
<span class="pb" id="page_36"><b class="pb">{Page 36}</b></span>
may know that I am the Lord God.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And “You will live in a lofty
cave in a strong rock, and its water is unfailing. You will see
the king in glory, and your soul will reflect on the fear of the
Lord.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And again in another prophet he says, “And he that does
these things will be like the tree that is planted by the streams of
water, which will yield its fruit in its proper season, and its leaf
will not fall off, and all that he does will prosper. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>It is not so with
the ungodly, it is not so! but they are like the chaff that the wind
sweeps from the face of the earth. That is why the ungodly will
not rise up in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the upright;
for the Lord knows the way of the upright, and the way
of the ungodly will perish.” <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Observe how he has defined the
water and the cross together. For this is what he means: Blessed
are those who have set their hope on the cross and gone down
into the water, for he speaks of their wages when they are due:
Then, he says, I will pay them. And when he now says, “His
leaves will not fall off,” he means this: that every word that goes
out of your mouths in faith and love will bring conversion and
hope to many. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And again another prophet says, “And the land
of Jacob was praised above all the earth.” He means this: he is
glorifying the instrument of his spirit. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>What does he say then?
“And there was a river flowing from the right hand, and beautiful
trees grew out of it, and whoever eats of them will live for
ever.” <sup class="verse">11 </sup>This means that we go down into the water full of sins
and pollution, and we come up bringing forth fear in our hearts
and with hope in Jesus in our spirit. “And whoever eats of these
will live forever” means this: whoever, he says, hears these things
said and believes them will live forever.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>Likewise he further ordains about the cross, in another prophet,
who says, “When shall these things be accomplished? The Lord
said, When a tree shall be bent down and rise up. and when
blood shall drip from a tree.” You have a fresh allusion to the
cross and to him who was to be crucified. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And he said again to
Moses when Israel was warred against by aliens, and so as to
<span class="pb" id="page_37"><b class="pb">{Page 37}</b></span>
remind them when they were being warred against that it was
because of their sins that they were delivered to death—the
spirit said to the heart of Moses, that he should make a symbol
of the cross and of him who was to suffer, because, he says,
unless they hope in him, they will be warred against forever. So
Moses piled one shield upon another in the midst of the fray, and
taking his stand high above them all he stretched out his hands,
and then Israel was victorious again; then when he let them fall,
they were slain again. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Why? To show them that they cannot be
saved unless they hope in him. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And again in another prophet he
says, “All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people
that disobeyed and disputed my upright way.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Again Moses
gives a symbol of Jesus, showing that he must suffer and he whom
they will think they have destroyed will himself give life, in a
figure given when Israel was falling. For the Lord made every
serpent bite them, and they were dying (since transgression
arose in Eve through the serpent), in order to convince them
that because of their transgression they would be consigned
to the affliction of death. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Finally Moses, though he commanded,
“You shall not have anything cast or carved for your God,” made
one himself to show them a symbol of Jesus. So Moses made a
bronze serpent and set it up conspicuously and assembled the
people by a proclamation. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So when they had come together, they
besought Moses to offer prayer for them, for their healing. But
Moses said to them, “Whenever,” said he, “one of you is bitten,
let him come to the serpent that is placed upon the pole, and
hope and believe that though it is dead it can give him life, and
he will immediately be saved.” And they did so. Here again you
have in this also the glory of Jews, because all things are in him
and point to him. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Again, what did Moses say to Jesus (Joshua)
the son of Nun, when he gave him, as being a prophet, this
name, solely in order that all the people might hear that the
Father was revealing everything about his Son Jesus? <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So Moses
said to Jesus the son of Nun, after he had given him this name,
<span class="pb" id="page_38"><b class="pb">{Page 38}</b></span>
when he sent him to spy out the land, “Take a scroll in your
hands and write what the Lord says, that the Son of God will in
the last days cut out the whole house of Amalek by the roots.”
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>See, again it is Jesus, not a son of man, but Son of God, and
symbolically revealed in flesh. Since therefore they were going
to say that the Christ is the son of David, David himself prophesied,
fearing and understanding the error of the sinners, “The
Lord has said to my lord, Sit at my right hand until I make
your enemies your footstool.” <sup class="verse">11 </sup>And again Isaiah says, “The
Lord said to my Lord Christ, whose right hand I have laid hold
of, that heathen would listen before him, and I will shatter the
might of kings.” See how David calls him Lord. and does not
call him son.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>Now let us see whether this people is the heir, or the former
people, and whether the agreement relates to us or to them.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Hear, then, what the scripture says about the people: “Isaac
prayed for his wife Rebecca, because she was barren; and she
conceived.” Then “Rebecca went off to consult the Lord, and
the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two
peoples in your body, and one people will master the other, and
the greater will serve the less.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You must understand who Isaac
was, and who Rebecca was, and of whom he has shown that
this people would be greater than that. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And in another prophecy
Jacob speaks more clearly to his son Joseph, saying, “Behold,
the Lord has not deprived me of your face; bring me your sons,
so that I may bless them.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And he brought Ephraim and
Manasseh, wishing that Manasseh should be blessed, because
he was the elder; for Joseph led him to the right hand of his
father Jacob. But Jacob saw in the spirit a symbol of the future
people, and what does it say? “And Jacob crossed his hands, and
put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, the second and
younger son, and he blessed him. And Joseph said to Jacob,
Transfer your right hand to the head of Manasseh, for he is my
first born son. And Jacob said to Joseph, I know, my child, I
<span class="pb" id="page_39"><b class="pb">{Page 39}</b></span>
know, but the greater will serve the less, though he also will be
blessed.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Observe on whom he laid hands, that this people should
be first and inherit the agreement. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>If, then, in addition he mentioned
it also in speaking of Abraham, we reach the perfection
of our knowledge. What, then, does he say to Abraham, when he
alone had faith and was ordained to be upright? “Behold, I have
made you, Abraham, the father of the heathen who though uncircumcised
will believe in God.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>Yes, but let us see whether he has given the people the agreement
which he swore to their forefathers to give them. Let us
inquire. He has given it! But because of their sins they were not
worthy to receive it. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the prophet says, “And Moses was
fasting on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights, to receive
the agreement of the Lord for the people. And Moses received
from the Lord the two tablets written in the spirit by the finger of
the Lord’s hand,” And Moses took them, and was carrying them
down, to give them to the people. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the Lord said to Moses,
“Moses, Moses, go down quickly, for your people whom you have
led out of the land of Egypt have broken the law.” And Moses
understood that they had again cast images for themselves, and
he flung the tablets from his hands, and the tablets of the Lord’s
agreement were broken in pieces. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Moses received it, but they
themselves proved unworthy. But learn how we received it.
Moses was a servant when he received it, but the Lord himself
gave it to us, as the people entitled to the inheritance, after he
had suffered for us. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And he was revealed in order that both they
might attain the fulness of their sins and we might receive the
agreement through the Lord Jesus, the heir to it, who was prepared
for this purpose, to appear and redeem from darkness our
hearts, already destroyed by death, and given up to the iniquity
of error, and make an agreement with us by his word. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For it is
written how the Father charged him to redeem us from darkness
and prepare a holy people for himself. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So the prophet says, “I,
the Lord your God, have called you in uprightness, and I will
grasp your hand and strengthen you, and I have made you an
<span class="pb" id="page_40"><b class="pb">{Page 40}</b></span>
agreement with the people, a light of the heathen, to open the
eyes of the blind, and to bring forth from their fetters those that
are bound, and from the prison house those that sit in darkness.”
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>So we know from what we have been redeemed. Again
the prophet says, “Behold, I have made you a light for the
heathen, to be a means of salvation to the ends of the earth, says
the Lord God who has redeemed you.” <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And again the prophet
says, “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has consecrated
me to preach the good news of his favour to the humble, he has
sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to announce to prisoners
their release, and to the blind the recovery of their sight, to
proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour and the day of recompense,
to comfort all that mourn.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>Further, then, it is written about the sabbath also in the Ten
Words which God uttered to Moses face to face on Mount
Sinai, “And treat the sabbath of the Lord as holy with clean
hands and a pure heart.” <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And in another place he says, “If my
sons keep the sabbath, I will let my mercy rest upon them.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>He
mentions the sabbath at the beginning of the creation: “And in
six days God made the works of his hands, and ended on the
seventh day, and he rested on it and made it holy.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Observe,
children, what “he ended in six days” means. This is what it
means, that in six thousand years the Lord will bring all
things to an end, for a day with him means a thousand years. He
himself bears me witness, for he says, “Behold, a day of the
Lord will be like a thousand years.” Therefore, children, in six
days, that is, in six thousand years, all things will be brought to
an end. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>“And he rested the seventh day” means this: When his
Son comes and destroys the time of the lawless one, and judges
the ungodly and changes the sun and moon and stars, then he
will rest well on the seventh day. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Further he says, “You shall treat
it as holy, with clean hands and a pure heart.” If, then, anyone
can now, by being pure in heart, treat as holy the day God
declared holy, we are entirely deceived. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Observe that we will
<span class="pb" id="page_41"><b class="pb">{Page 41}</b></span>
find true rest and treat it as holy only when we shall be able to
do so having ourselves been made upright and had the promise
fulfilled, when there is no more disobedience, but all things
have been made new by the Lord. Then we shall be able to
treat it as holy, after we have first been made holy ourselves.
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>Further he says to them, “Your new moons and sabbaths I cannot
endure.” You see what he means: it is not the present sabbaths
that are acceptable to me, but the one that I have made, on
which, having brought everything to rest, I will make the
beginning of an eighth day, that is, the beginning of another
world. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>This is why we also observe the eighth day with rejoicing,
on which Jesus also rose from the dead, and having shown himself
ascended to heaven.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>In addition, I will also tell you about the temple, how those
wretched men went astray and set their hope on a building, as
being the house of God, instead of on God who made them.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>For they propitiated him in the temple almost like the heathen.
But learn how the Lord speaks, in abolishing it: “Who has
measured the heaven with a span, or the earth with his hand?
Have not I? says the Lord. The heaven is my throne, and the
earth is my footstool! What kind of house can you build for me,
or in what place can I rest?” You know that their hope was vain.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>Further, he says again, “Behold, those that tore down this temple
will build it up themselves.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>This is taking place. For because
they went to war, it was torn down by their enemies; now
the very servants of their enemies will build it up again. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Again,
it was revealed that the city and the temple and the people of
Israel were to be delivered up. For the scripture says, “And it
shall come to pass in the last days that the Lord will deliver up
the sheep of the pasture and the sheepfold and the tower to
destruction.” And it took place as the Lord had said. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But let us
inquire whether there is a temple of God. There is, where he himself
said he would make it and finish it. For it is written, “And it
<span class="pb" id="page_42"><b class="pb">{Page 42}</b></span>
shall came to pass, when the week is ending, a temple of God
will be built in glory in the name of the Lord.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>I find, therefore,
that there is a temple. Learn, then, how it is to be built in the
name of the Lord. Before we believed in God, the dwelling of our
heart was perishable and weak, like a temple actually built with
hands, for it was full of idolatry and was the home of demons,
because we did what was opposed to God. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>“But it will be built
in the name of the Lord.” But take heed that the temple of the
Lord may be built in glory. Learn how. When we received forgiveness
of sins and set our hope on the name, we became new,
created again from the beginning, and therefore God really lives
in us, in the dwelling which we are. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>How? His word of faith,
the call of his promise, the wisdom of his decrees, the commands
of his teaching, he himself prophesying within us, he himself
dwelling in us, opening the temple door, that is, the mouth,
and giving us repentance, leads us, who were enslaved to death,
into the indestructible temple. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>For the man who longs to be
saved looks not at the speaker but at him who dwells in him
and speaks through him, amazed at him, and at never having
heard him utter such words with his mouth or having himself
ever wanted to hear them. This is the spiritual temple that is
being built for the Lord.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">17 </b>As far as it was possible to show them to you with simplicity,
my soul hopes that, as I have desired, I have not left out any of
the things that have to do with salvation. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if I write to you
about the present or the future, you will not understand because
they are put in figures.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">18 </sup>So much for that. Now let us pass to another lesson and teaching.
There are two ways of teaching and power, that of light
and that of darkness, and there is a great difference between
the two ways. For on one are stationed light-giving angels of
God, but on the other angels of Satan. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And the one is Lord from
eternity to eternity, while the other is ruler of the present time
of iniquity.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_43"><b class="pb">{Page 43}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">19 </b>This then is the way of light, if anyone wishing to make his
way to his appointed place will be zealous in all his works. The
knowledge, then, that is given us so that we may walk in it is as
follows: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You shall love your Maker, you shall fear your Creator,
you shall glorify him who redeemed you from death; you shall
be simple in heart and rich in spirit. You shall not join those who
walk in the way of death. You shall hate everything that is not
pleasing to God, you shall hate all hypocrisy. You must not forsake
the commands of the Lord. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You shall not exalt yourself,
but shall be humble-minded in all things. You shall not take
glory to yourself. You shall not form an evil design against your
neighbour, you shall not admit arrogance to your soul. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>You shall
not commit fornication, you shall not commit adultery, you shall
not corrupt boys. The word of God shall not go forth from you
among the impure. You shall not show favouritism in rebuking
anyone for transgression. You shall be meek, you shall be quiet,
you shall stand in awe of the words that you have heard. You
shall not hold a grudge against your brother. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>You must not doubt
whether a thing shall be or not. “You must not take the name of
the Lord in vain.” You shall love your neighbour more than your
life. You shall not murder a child by abortion, or kill it when it
is born. You must not withhold your hand from your son or from
your daughter, but from their youth you shall teach them the fear
of God. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>You must not desire your neighbour’s goods, you must
not be covetous. You shall not join heartily with haughty people,
but shall associate with humble and upright men. You shall accept
the experiences that befall you as good, knowing that nothing
happens without God. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You shall not be double-minded or double-tongued,
for the double tongue is a deadly snare. You shall obey
your masters with modesty and fear, as a symbol of God. You
must not give orders in bitterness to your man or woman slave
who hopes in the same God, lest they cease to fear the God who
is over you both, for he came not to call men with partiality, but
those whom the spirit had prepared. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>You shall share everything
<span class="pb" id="page_44"><b class="pb">{Page 44}</b></span>
with your neighbour, and shall not call things your own. For if
you share what is imperishable, how much more the things that
are perishable? You shall not be quick to speak, for the mouth
is a deadly snare. As far as you can, you shall be pure for your
soul’s sake. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Do not be stretching out your hands to take, and
closing them when it comes to giving. You shall love as the apple
of your eye everyone who speaks the word of the Lord to you.
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>Night and day you shall remember the Day of Judgment, and
every day you shall seek the company of the saints, either labouring
by word of mouth, and going out to exhort, and busying
yourself in saving souls by the word, or you shall work with
your hands for the ransom of your sins. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>You shall not hesitate to
give, nor grumble when you give, but you shall know who is the
good payer of wages. You shall keep the teachings you have
received, neither adding to them nor taking from them. You
shall absolutely hate evil. You shall judge uprightly. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>You shall
not cause division, but shall bring fighters together and reconcile
them. You shall confess your sins. You shall not approach prayer
with an evil conscience. This is the way of light.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">20 </b>But the way of the Black One is crooked and full of cursing.
For it is a way of eternal death and punishment, and in it are
the things that destroy men’s souls—idolatry, arrogance, the
exaltation of power, hypocrisy, duplicity, adultery, murder, robbery,
pride, transgression, fraud, malice, willfulness, enchantment,
magic, covetousness, disregard of God; <sup class="verse">2 </sup>persecutors of good men,
hating truth, loving falsehood, ignorant of the wages of uprightness,
not adhering to what is good nor to upright judgment, paying
no heed to the widow and orphan, lying awake not in the fear
of God, but for what is evil, from whom gentleness and patience
are far, far away, loving vanity, seeking reward, without pity for
the poor, not toiling for the oppressed, ready with slander, ignoring
their Maker, murderers of children, corrupters of God’s
creatures, turning away the needy, oppressing the afflicted, advocates
of the rich, unjust judges of the poor, utterly sinful.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_45"><b class="pb">{Page 45}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">21 </b>It is well, therefore, after learning the ordinances of the Lord
above written to live by them. For the man who does so will be
glorified in the kingdom of God; the one that chooses their
opposites will perish with his works. This is the reason for resurrection,
this is the reason for recompense. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I entreat those who are
in high position, if you will accept my well-meant advice, you
have among you those whom you can benefit: do not fail them.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>The day is near when all things will perish with the Evil One.
The Lord is at hand, with his reward. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Again and again I entreat
you; be good lawgivers to one another, remain faithful counsellors
of one another, put away from you all hypocrisy. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>May God, who
rules over the whole world, give you wisdom, intelligence, understanding,
knowledge of his ordinances, and endurance. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Be taught
of God, seeking to find what the Lord asks of you, and do it, so
that you may be found on the day of judgment. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And if there is
any remembrance of what is good, remember me as you meditate
on these things, so that my desire and vigilance may lead
to some good; I ask it of you as a favour. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>While you are still in this
fair vessel, do not fall short of any of them, but earnestly seek,
these things, and fulfill every command, for they deserve it. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>This
is why I have been the more eager to write to you as well as I
could, to cheer you. Win salvation, children of love and peace.
The Lord of glory and all grace be with your spirits.</p>

<h2>The First Letter of Clement—To the Corinthians</h2>

<p>The earliest Christian document that has come down to as outside
the New Testament is the letter written in the name of the
church at Rome to the church at Corinth, probably about A.D. 95.
The Corinthian church, which had from the beginning made so
much of spiritual gifts and endowments, was showing marked
hostility to the office of elder or presbyter in the church, and
the Roman church, probably stirred by the charge made in
Hebrews 5:12 that it was remiss in not teaching the other
churches, undertook to correct this attitude. This explains the
strangely awkward apology for not having written them before
on the subject, with which I Clement begins. The Roman church
was at the same time addressing what we know as I Peter to the
churches of Asia Minor, doubtless in response to the same sense
of responsibility awakened by Hebrews.</p>

<p>It was a decade of extraordinary literary activity on the part
of the new religion. The publication of Luke-Acts, a sketch of
the beginnings of Christianity, in two volumes, had been followed
by the publication of the collected letters of Paul, the Revelation
of John, and, to offset its bitter attitude toward the empire and
the emperor, I Peter. And at about the same time that the Roman
church was seeking through that letter to save the churches of
Asia Minor from the danger of hating their enemies, it sought
with I Clement to correct what it considered the rebellious
attitude of the Corinthians toward their church officers.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_48"><b class="pb">{Page 48}</b></span></p>

<p>It does not name its writer, but from ancient times the letter
has been ascribed to Clement, who was bishop of Rome from
A.D. 88 to 97, and no serious objection to this authorship can be
raised. The free use of the principal letters of Paul, the writer’s
familiarity with Hebrews, and the marked kinship of the letter
with I Peter strongly favour a date about A.D. 95 and the writer’s
nonacquaintance with the fourfold gospel accords well with this
date. Clement is spoken of by Hermas, about A.D. 100, as in
charge of communications with the churches of other cities,
Visions ii.4.3, which sounds like a reminiscence of the service of
this kind he had performed in I Clement.</p>

<p>I Clement is a good example of the letter form of Christian
instruction that had been standardized by the recent collection
and publication of the Pauline letters, perhaps about A.D. 93.
The writer condemns the Corinthians’ insubordination, and urges
them to follow the great Old Testament examples, showing
great familiarity with the Greek version of the Old Testament.
He points out the humility of Christ and the order that prevails
in the world of nature, and counsels love, forgiveness, humility,
and reconciliation.</p>

<p>I Clement has come down to us in Greek near the close of the
Codex Alexandrinus, of the fifth century, and in the eleventh-century
manuscript found by Bryennius in 1873. Syriac, Latin,
and Coptic versions of it have also come to light.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_49"><b class="pb">{Page 49}</b></span></p>

<h2>The First Letter of Clement—To the Corinthians</h2>

<p>The church of God that is staying in Rome to the church of
God that is staying in Corinth, to those who are called and
consecrated by the will of God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
may God Almighty bless you and give you peace abundantly
through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Because of the sudden and repeated misfortunes and calamities
that have befallen us, we think we have been very slow
in giving attention to the matters that are being discussed among
you dear friends and to the foul and impious uprising, so alien
and foreign to God’s chosen people, which a few headstrong and
wilful men have kindled to such a frenzy that your good name,
respected and renowned and universally beloved, has come to
be greatly reviled. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For who that ever visited you did not approve
the virtue and steadfastness of your faith? Who did not admire
the seriousness and Christian gentleness of your piety? Who did
not proclaim your magnificent disposition toward hospitality?
Who did not congratulate you on your full, sound knowledge?
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>You did everything without partiality, and lived in accordance
with the laws of God, obeying your leaders and paying the
older men among you the respect due them. Young people you
instructed to think modestly and properly, and, women you
charged to do everything with a blameless, devout, and pure
conscience, showing their husbands rightful affection; and you
taught them to respect their sphere of subjection and to keep
house with dignity and good sense.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_50"><b class="pb">{Page 50}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>You were all humble-minded and not at all arrogant, subordinating
yourselves instead of subordinating others, giving more
gladly than receiving. You were satisfied with what Christ supplies,
and heeding his words you laid them up carefully in your
hearts and kept his sufferings before your eyes. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So a deep, rich
peace was granted to all of you, and an insatiable desire to do
good, and the holy Spirit was poured out in abundance upon you
all. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You were full of holy designs, and with pious confidence, in
eager goodness you stretched out your hands to Almighty God,
beseeching him to have mercy if you had involuntarily committed
a sin. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Day and night you engaged in a conflict for all
the brotherhood, that through mercy and conscience the number
of his chosen might be saved. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>You were sincere and without
guile, with no malice to one another. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Any uprising or division
was abominated by you. You mourned over the transgressions of
your neighbours; you considered their shortcomings to be your
own. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You had no regrets for any act of kindness, you were ready
for any good work. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Adorned by your virtuous and august
manner of life, you did everything in fear of him; the commands
and decrees of the Lord were written on the tablets of your
hearts.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>All glory and expansion were given you, and the scripture was
fulfilled: “My Beloved ate and drank, and he expanded and grew
fat and began to kick.” <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So arose jealousy and envy, strife and
uprising, persecution and confusion, war and captivity. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the
worthless were stirred up against the reputable, those of no repute
against those of good repute, the foolish against the sensible, the
young against their elders. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For this reason uprightness and peace
are far off, while each one abandons the fear of God and faith
in him grows dim, and men do not walk in the rules of his commandments
or live as befits Christ, but each follows the desires of
his wicked heart, adopting that unrighteous and ungodly jealousy
through which death came into the world.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_51"><b class="pb">{Page 51}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>For thus it is written: “And it came to pass in the course of
time that Cain brought some produce of the soil as an offering to
God, and Abel also brought some of the first born of his sheep
and some fat pieces of them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And God noticed Abel and his gifts,
but he took no notice of Cain and his offerings. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And Cain was
very much hurt and downcast. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And God said to Cain, ‘Why are
you hurt, and why are you downcast? If you offer rightly, but
do not decide rightly, do you not sin? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Be silent. He shall turn
to you, and you shall rule him.’</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>“And Cain said to brother Abel, ‘Let us go off into the country.’
And it came to pass while they were in the country, that
Cain attacked his brother Abel, and killed him.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You see,
brethren, jealousy and envy brought about a brother’s murder.
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>Because of jealousy our father Jacob ran away from the presence
of his brother Esau. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Jealousy caused Joseph to be persecuted even
to death and be reduced to slavery. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>Jealousy forced Moses to flee
from the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, when his own
countryman said to him, “Who made you a ruler or judge over
us? Do you mean to kill me, as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?”
<sup class="verse">11 </sup>Because of jealousy Aaron and Miriam were made to lodge
outside the camp. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>Jealousy carried Dathan and Abiram alive
down to Hades, because they made an uprising against God’s
servant Moses. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>Because of jealousy David was envied not only
by the Philistines but was persecuted even by Saul, king of
Israel.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>But to pass from ancient examples, let us come to those who
have most recently proved champions; let us take up the noble
examples of our own generation. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Because of jealousy and envy
the greatest and most upright pillars of the church were persecuted
and competed unto death. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us bring before our eyes
the good apostles!—<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Peter, who because of unrighteous jealousy
endured not one or two, but numerous trials, and so bore a
martyr’s witness and went to the glorious place that he deserved.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>Because of jealousy and strife Paul pointed the way to the
reward of endurance; <sup class="verse">6 </sup>seven times he was imprisoned, he was
<span class="pb" id="page_52"><b class="pb">{Page 52}</b></span>
exiled, he was stoned, he was a preacher in both east and west,
and won great renown for his faith, <sup class="verse">7 </sup>teaching uprightness to the
whole world, and reaching the farthest limit of the west, and
bearing a martyr’s witness before the rulers he passed out of the
world and was taken up into the holy place, having proved a very
great example of endurance.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>With these men who had lived holy lives has been gathered a
great multitude of God’s chosen, who have set a splendid example
among us in enduring many humiliations and tortures on
account of jealousy. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>On account of jealousy women have been
persecuted and made to endure dreadful and unholy insults, as
Danaids and Dirces, and reached the sure goal in the race of
faith and won the true prize, weak in body though they were.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>Jealousy has estranged wives from their husbands, and nullified
the words of our forefather Adam, “This now is bone of my bones,
and flesh of my flesh.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Jealousy and strife have overthrown great
cities and uprooted great nations.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>We write this, dear friends, not only to warn you, but also to
remind ourselves, for we are in the same arena, and the same contest
is before us. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Therefore let us give up idle, vain considerations,
and let us turn to the renowned and solemn standard that
has come down to us, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>and see what is good and pleasant and
acceptable in the sight of our Maker. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Let us fix our eyes on the
blood of Christ and learn how precious it is to his Father, because
it was shed for our salvation, and brought the blessing of repentance
to the whole world. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Let us survey all the generations and
learn that in generation after generation the Master has offered
those who wished to turn to him an opportunity to repent. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Noah
preached repentance and those who obeyed were saved. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Jonah
warned the men of Nineveh of destruction, but they repented
of their sins and besought God and were forgiven and saved,
although they were aliens from God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>The ministers of the favour of God through the holy Spirit
told about repentance, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>and the Master of all things himself spoke
<span class="pb" id="page_53"><b class="pb">{Page 53}</b></span>
of repentance with an oath: “For as I live, said the Lord, I do
not desire the sinner’s death so much as his repentance,” and
he added a blessed thought, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Repent of your iniquity, house of
Israel. Say to the sons of my people, If your sins reach from
earth to heaven, and if they are redder than scarlet and blacker
than sackcloth, and you turn to me with all your hearts, and say
‘Father!’ I will listen to you as a holy people.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And in another
place he speaks thus: “Wash yourselves and be made clean, put
away the wickedness from your souls before my eyes. Cease from
your wickedness, learn to do right, seek justice, deliver the
oppressed, uphold the rights of the orphan, and do justice to
the widow; and come, let us reason together, says the Lord;
though your sins are like crimson, I will make them white as
snow; though they are like scarlet, I will make them white as
wool. And if you are willing, and listen to me, you will eat the
good of the land, but if you are not willing and do not listen
to me, the sword will devour you, for the mouth of the Lord
has said this.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So wishing to give all his beloved a share in
repentance, he has established it by his omnipotent decree.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>Let us therefore obey his magnificent and glorious desire and
as suppliants of his mercy and goodness let us fall before him,
and return to his compassion, forsaking labour that is in vain and
strife and jealousy that lead to death. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let us look closely at those
who have perfectly served his sublime glory. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us take Enoch,
who was found upright in obedience and was taken up, and did
not experience death. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Noah was found faithful and through his
service proclaimed rebirth to the world, and through him the
Master saved the animals who entered in harmony into the ark.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Abraham, who was called “the friend,” proved faithful when
he obeyed the commands of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>He went forth obediently from
his country and his kindred and his father’s house, to leave a
little country and a weak clan and a small household, and inherit
what God promised. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For he said to him, “Leave your country
and your kindred and your father’s house for the land that I will
<span class="pb" id="page_54"><b class="pb">{Page 54}</b></span>
show you, and I will make you a great nation, and I will bless
you and make your name great, and you will be blessed. I will
bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you, and
all the families of the earth will be blest through you.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And
again when he parted from Lot God said to him, “Raise your eyes
and look from the place where you now are north, south, east
and west, for all the land that you see I will give to you and
your descendants forever. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And I will make your descendants like
the dust of the earth; if a man can count the dust of the earth,
your descendants can be counted.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And again it says, “God
brought Abraham out and said to him, ‘Look up at the heavens
and count the stars, if you can count them; so shall your
descendants be.’ And Abraham had faith in God, and it was
credited to him as uprightness.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Because of his faith and his
hospitality a son was given him in his old age, and in his
obedience he offered him in sacrifice to God on one of the
mountains he had shown him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>Because of his hospitality and piety Lot was saved from Sodom,
when all the country round was judged with fire and brimstone,
when the Master made it clear that he does not forsake those
that hope in him, but those that turn aside he consigns to punishment
and torment. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when his wife, who had gone out with
him, changed her mind and disagreed with him, she was made a
symbol of this, and became a pillar of salt unto this day, to make
known to all that those who are dubious and doubtful about
the power of God are condemned and become a warning for all
generations.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>Because of her faith and hospitality Rahab the harlot was
saved. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when the scouts were sent out to Jericho by Joshua
the son of Nun, the king of that country found out that they
had come to spy out their land, and he sent men to arrest them,
so that they might be taken and put to death. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the hospitable
Rahab took them in and hid them in the upstairs room under
the stalks of flax. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And when the king’s men came and said, “The
<span class="pb" id="page_55"><b class="pb">{Page 55}</b></span>
men who are spying out our land went in to your house; bring
them out, for those are the kings orders,” she answered, “The
men you are looking for came to my house, but they went away
immediately and are going on their way,” and pointed in the
wrong direction. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Then she said to the men, “I am convinced that
the Lord God is going to give you this country, for the fear
and terror of you have fallen upon its inhabitants. So when it
comes about that you take it, you must save me and my father’s
household.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And they said to her, “It shall be done, just as you
have told us. So when you learn that we are coming, you must
gather all your people under your roof, and they will be saved;
for all that are found outside the house will perish.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>They also
gave her a signal, that she should hang a piece of scarlet from
her house, thus showing that all who believed and set their hope
on God should have redemption through the blood of the Lord.
You see, dear friends, that there was not only faith but prophecy
in this woman.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>So let us be humble-minded, brethren, and put aside all pretensions
and conceit and folly and anger, and let us do what the
scripture says. For the holy Spirit says, “The wise man must not
boast of his wisdom, nor the strong man of his strength, nor the
rich man of his riches, but the man who boasts must boast of
the Lord, to seek him out and do justice and uprightness.
Especially remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he uttered
when he was teaching gentleness and patience. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For this is what
he said: “Show mercy, that you may be shown mercy. Forgive,
that you may be forgiven. As you do, so it will be done to you;
as you give, so it will be given to you; as you judge, so you will
be judged; as you are kind, so kindness will be shown to you.
The measure you use will be used in measuring to you.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>With
this command and these orders let us strengthen one another
that we may live in obedience to his hallowed words, in humble-mindedness.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>For the holy word says, “On whom shall I look but
on him that is humble and gentle and trembles at my words?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_56"><b class="pb">{Page 56}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>It is right and proper then, brethren, for us to be obedient
to God rather than to follow those who in arrogance and disorder
are the instigators of detestable jealousy. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For we shall incur no
ordinary injury but great danger if we recklessly surrender
ourselves to the purposes of these men who plunge into strife
and discord, to alienate us from what is right. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us show
kindness to one another with the compassion and sweetness of
our Creator. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For it is written, “The kind will be the inhabitants
of the land, and the innocent will be left upon it, but those who
transgress will be destroyed from upon it.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And again it says, “I
saw the ungodly triumphing and towering aloft like the cedars of
Lebanon; but I went by and behold, he was not, and I looked
for his place, and could not find it. Keep watch of innocence, and
look at uprightness, for there is a posterity for the peaceable
man.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>Let us therefore cling to those who keep the peace in piety, not
those who hypocritically wish for peace. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For it says somewhere,
“This people honours me with the lips, but their heart is far from
me.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And again, “They blessed with their mouth, but cursed
in their heart.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And again it says, “They loved him with their
mouth, and with their tongue they lied to him, but their heart
was not straightforward with him, nor were they faithful to his
covenant.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Therefore, “Let the deceitful lips be dumb that talk
of lawlessness against the upright,” and again, “May the Lord
destroy all deceitful lips, the boastful tongue, men that say ‘We
will magnify our tongue, our lips are with us: who is lord over
us?’ <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For the wretchedness of the poor and the groaning of the
needy I will now arise, says the Lord, I will place him in safety,
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>I will deal boldly by him.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>For Christ belongs to the humble-minded, not to those who
exalt themselves over the flock. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The sceptre of the majesty of
God, the Lord Jesus Christ did not come with the boast of
arrogance or pride, though he was able to do so, but in humbleness
of mind, as the holy Spirit said of him, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>for it says, “Lord,
<span class="pb" id="page_57"><b class="pb">{Page 57}</b></span>
who has believed what we heard, and to whom has the arm of
the Lord been revealed? We proclaimed him before the Lord as
a child, as a root in dry ground. He has no comeliness or glory,
and we saw him and he had no comeliness or beauty, but his
appearance was insignificant, inferior to the beauty of men, a
man of stripes and toil, who knew how to endure pain. For his
face was turned away, he was dishonoured and discountenanced.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>It was he that bore our sins and endured pain for us, and we
considered him as one in trouble, stripes, and affliction. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But he
was wounded for our sins, and made to suffer for our iniquities.
The chastisement of our peace was put upon him; through his
stripes we were healed. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>We had all gone astray like sheep; each
one had gone astray by his own path; <sup class="verse">7 </sup>and the Lord gave him up
for our sins. And he did not open his month because of his ill-treatment.
Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered, and
as a lamb is dumb before its shearer, he did not open his
mouth. His sentence ended in his humiliation. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Who will tell the
story of his posterity? <sup class="verse">9 </sup>For his life is perished from the earth.
Because of the iniquities of my people he has gone to his death.
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>And I will offer the wicked for his burial and the rich for his
death, for he did no iniquity, and no deceit was found in his
mouth. And it is the Lord’s will to cleanse him of his stripes. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>If
you make an offering for sin your soul shall see a long-lived
posterity. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>And it is the Lord’s will to take from the toil of his
soul, to show him light, and shape him with intelligence, to
make upright an upright man who serves many well, and he
himself will bear their sins. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>Therefore he will be the heir of
many, and share the spoils of the strong, because his life was
given up to death and he was counted among the lawless. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>He
bore the sins of many, and because of their sins he was given
up.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">15 </sup>And again he says himself, “I am a worm and not a man, a
shame to mankind, and despised by the people. <sup class="verse">16 </sup>All who see me
mock me; they make mouths, they shake their heads: ‘He hopes
<span class="pb" id="page_58"><b class="pb">{Page 58}</b></span>
in the Lord! Let him deliver him; let him save him, since he is
pleased with him!’”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">17 </sup>You see, dear friends, what the example is that has been given
us. For if the Lord was so humbled-minded, what are we to do
who through him have come under the yoke of his favour?</p>

<p><b class="chapter">17 </b>Let us also be imitators of those who went about in the
skins of goats and sheep, preaching the coming of Christ; I mean
Elijah and Elisha, and Ezekiel too, the prophets, and besides
them the famous men. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Abraham was far-famed, and called a
friend of God, yet when he beheld the glory of God he said
humbly, “I am but dust and ashes.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Of Job also it is written, “Now Job was upright and blameless,
true, godly, keeping himself from all evil.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Why, he accuses himself,
for he says, “No one is free from defilement, if he lives only
a day.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>Moses was called faithful in all God’s house, and through his
service God judged Egypt by the plagues and torments inflicted
on them. But though he was so greatly glorified he did not
boast, but when the oracle was given to him from the bush, he
said, “Who am I, that you send me? I am weak-voiced and slow
of speech.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And again he says, “I am but smoke from the pot.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">18 </b>And what are we to say of the famous David, of whom God
said, “I have found a man after my own heart in David, the son
of Jesse; I have anointed him with eternal mercy.” <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But he himself
says to God, “Have mercy on me, O God, in your great mercy,
and in the abundance of your compassion, wipe out my transgression.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me of
my sin, for I know my iniquity and my sin is always before me.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Against you only have I sinned, and I have done what was evil
in your sight, that you may be in the right when you speak and
prevail when you give judgment. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For I was conceived in iniquity,
and my mother bore me in sin. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For behold, you love truth;
the secret and hidden matters of your wisdom you make known
to me. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed;
<span class="pb" id="page_59"><b class="pb">{Page 59}</b></span>
you shall wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>You shall
make me hear joy and gladness; my humbled bones will rejoice.
<sup class="verse">9 </sup>Turn your face from my sins, and wipe out all my iniquities.
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right spirit
within me. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>Do not cast me out of your presence, and do not take
your holy Spirit from me. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>Give me back the gladness of your
salvation, and sustain me with your guiding spirit. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>I will teach
the lawless your ways, and ungodly men will return to you. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>Save
me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my deliverance. <sup class="verse">15 </sup>My
tongue will rejoice in your uprightness. Lord, you shall open my
mouth, and my lips will declare your praise. <sup class="verse">16 </sup>For if you had
desired sacrifice, I would have given it; you will take no pleasure
in burnt offerings. <sup class="verse">17 </sup>The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit; a
broken and humbled heart God will not despise.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">19 </b>The humility and submission of so many men of such fame
have through their obedience made not only us but the generations
before us better, as well as all who have received his
oracles in fear and truth. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So since we have had a share in many
great and glorious deeds, let us run toward the goal of peace that
was given us from the beginning, and let us fix our eyes on the
Father and Creator of the whole world and cling to his splendid
and surpassing gifts of peace and benefits. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us see him with
our mind and look with the eyes of the soul at his patient purpose.
Let us consider how free from anger he is toward all his
creation.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">20 </b>The heavens are moved by his management and obey him in
peace. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Day and night pursue the course fixed by him without
hindering each other. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The sun and the moon and the troops
of stars roll harmoniously on their appointed courses under his
direction, without any divergence from them. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>By his will the
earth becomes fruitful and at the proper seasons produces ample
food for man and beast and all the living creatures on it, without
disagreement or changing any of his decisions. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>The unfathomable
depths of the abysses and the indescribable verdicts of the
<span class="pb" id="page_60"><b class="pb">{Page 60}</b></span>
underworld are held together by the same decrees. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>The basin of
the boundless sea was gathered by his creative action into its
bodies and does not go beyond the barriers surrounding it but
does as he commanded it. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For he said, “Thus far you shall come
and no farther, and your waves will break within you.” <sup class="verse">8 </sup>The
ocean, impassable to man, and the worlds beyond it are regulated
by the same orders from the Master. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>The spring, summer,
autumn, and winter seasons peacefully succeed one another.
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>The winds from their respective quarters inoffensively perform
their service at the proper times. Perennial springs, created for
enjoyment and health, unfailingly offer their life-giving breasts
to man, and the smallest of animals get together in harmony
and peace. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>All these things the great Creator and Master of the
universe ordered to be in peace and harmony, in his kindness
to all things and especially to us who have taken refuge in
his mercy through our Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="verse">12 </sup>to whom be glory
and majesty forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">21 </b>Take care, dear friends, that his many benefits do not bring
condemnation upon us, if we do not live worthily of him, and
harmoniously do what is good and well-pleasing in his sight.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>For it says somewhere, “The spirit of the Lord is a lamp that
searches the storerooms of the heart.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us observe how near
he is, and that none of our thoughts or of the reflections in which
we indulge escapes him. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>It is right therefore that we should
not be deserters from what he wills. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Let us give offence to
foolish and thoughtless men who exalt themselves and glory in
the arrogance of their speech, rather than to God. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Let us revere
the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood was given for us, let us
respect our rulers, let us honour our elders, let us train the young
in the fear of God, let us guide our wives to what is good. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Let
them exhibit the lovable quality of purity, let them display their
sincere gentleness of disposition, let them show the forbearance
of their tongues by their silence, let them bestow their affection
not with partiality but in holiness upon all alike who fear God.
<span class="pb" id="page_61"><b class="pb">{Page 61}</b></span>
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>Let our children share in Christian instruction, let them learn
what power humility has with God, what pure love can do with
God, how good and great his fear is, and how it saves those who
live in it in holiness with a pure mind. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>For he is the searcher
of thoughts and desires; his breath is in us, and when he pleases
he will take it away.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">22 </b>Faith in Christ confirms all this, for he himself through the
holy Spirit invites us thus: “Come, children, listen to me, I will
teach you to revere the Lord. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>What man is there that desires life,
and loves to see good days? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Keep your tongue from evil and your
lips from uttering deceit. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Turn from evil, and do what is good.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>Seek peace and pursue it. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>The Lord’s eyes are on the upright,
and his ears are open to their appeal. The Lord’s face is against
those that do evil, to destroy the memory of them from the earth.
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>The upright cries out, and the Lord hears him, and delivers him
from all his troubles. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>The scourgings of the sinner are many, but
mercy will surround those who hope in the Lord.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">23 </b>The all-merciful and beneficent Father has pity on those who
fear him, and kindly and lovingly confers his favours on those
who approach him with a sincere mind. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Therefore let us not
waver, nor let our souls indulge in fancies over his surpassing
and glorious gifts. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Far be that scripture from us where it says,
“How wretched are those who waver, who are of a doubting
heart, and say, ‘We heard those things even in our forefather’s
time, and here we have grown old, and none of them has happened
to us.’ <sup class="verse">4 </sup>You senseless people! Compare yourselves to a
tree; take a vine. First it sheds its leaves, then a shoot appears,
then a leaf, then a flower, and afterward a sour grape, then a
ripe grape.” You see that in a short time the fruit of the tree
comes to maturity. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>In very truth his will will be quickly
and suddenly accomplished as the scripture also bears witness;
“He will come quickly and not delay, and the Lord will come
suddenly to his temple, and the Holy One for whom you look.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">24 </b>Let us consider, dear friends, how the Master is continually
<span class="pb" id="page_62"><b class="pb">{Page 62}</b></span>
proving to us that there is to be a resurrection, of which he
made the Lord Jesus Christ the first fruits when he raised him
from the dead. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let us observe, dear friends, the resurrection
that is regularly taking place. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Day and night show us a resurrection;
night falls asleep, day arises! day departs, night comes on.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Let us take the crops; how and in what way does the sowing
take place? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>The sower goes out and sows each seed in the
ground. They fall into the ground dry and bare, and decay;
then from their decay the greatness of the Master’s providence
raises them up, and from a single grain many spring up and bear
fruit.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">25 </b>Let us observe the marvellous symbol that takes place in the
east, that is, in the region of Arabia. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For there is a bird that
is called a phoenix. It is the only one of its kind, and lives five
hundred years. And when it approaches its time to depart and
die, it makes itself a nest of frankincense and myrrh and other
spices, and when the time has come it gets into it and dies. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>As its
flesh decays a kind of worm comes into being, which feeds upon
the moisture of the dead creature and becomes full-fledged. Then
when it is full grown it takes up the nest containing the bones
of its parent and succeeds in carrying them from the country
of Arabia all the way to Egypt, to the city called Heliopolis,
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>and in broad daylight, in the sight of all, it lights upon the altar
of the Sun and deposits them there and then starts back again.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>So the priests consult their records of dates, and find that it has
come at the conclusion of the five hundredth year.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">26 </b>Do we, then, regard it as a great and marvellous thing for the
Creator of all things to bring about the resurrection of those
who have served him with holiness in the assurance of a good
faith, when even by a bird he shows us the greatness of his
promise? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For it says somewhere, “And you will raise me up and
I will praise you,” and “I lie down and sleep; I awake, for you
are with me.” And again Job says, “And you will raise up this
flesh of mine, which has endured all these things.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_63"><b class="pb">{Page 63}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">27 </b>With this hope, then, let our souls be bound to him that is
faithful to his promises and upright in his judgments. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>He who
has commanded us not to lie will much more not lie himself.
For nothing is impossible for God except lying. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So let faith
in him be rekindled in us, and let us consider that all things
are near him. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>With his majestic word he constituted all things,
and with a word he can overturn them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Who can say to him,
“What have you done?” or who can withstand the strength of
his might? When he pleases and as he pleases he will do everything,
and none of the things he has decreed will pass away. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>All
things are in his sight, and nothing has escaped his will, <sup class="verse">7 </sup>since
“the heavens are telling the glory of God, and the sky proclaims
the work of his hands. Day pours forth speech to day, and night
announces knowledge to night. There are no words, nor is there
any speech; their voices are not heard.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">28 </b>Since, then, all things are seen and heard, let us revere him,
and give up low acts of foul desire, that we may be shielded by
his mercy from the judgments that are to come. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For where
can any of us fly from his mighty hand? And what world can
receive one who deserts from him? For the scripture somewhere
says, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Where shall I go and where shall I hide from your face?
If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I go off to the ends of
the earth, there is your right hand. If I make my bed in the
abyss, there is your spirit.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Where, then, can a man go or where
can he escape from him who embraces all things?</p>

<p><b class="chapter">29 </b>Let us, then, approach him with holiness of spirit, lifting up
to him hands that are pure and undefiled, loving our forbearing
and merciful Father who has made us his chosen portion. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For
thus it is written: “When the Most High divided the nations,
when he scattered the descendants of Adam, he fixed the boundaries
of the nations in accordance with the number of the angels
of God. His people Jacob became the Lord’s portion; Israel was
the allotment that fell to him.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And in another place it says,
“Behold the Lord takes from among the nations a nation for
<span class="pb" id="page_64"><b class="pb">{Page 64}</b></span>
himself, as a man takes the first fruits of his threshing floor,
and out of that nation what is most holy will come.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">30 </b>So since we are a holy portion let us do all the things that
belong to holiness, fleeing from evil-speaking, vile impure embraces,
drunkenness and innovations and detestable desires,
wretched adultery and detestable pride. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>“For God,” it says,
“opposes haughty persons, but he favours humble-minded ones.”
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>So let us join those to whom favour is given by God. Let us clothe
ourselves with harmony, in humility and self-control, keeping
ourselves far from all gossip and slander, and be justified by
deeds, not by words. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For it says, “He who says much will hear
much in reply; or does the babbler think he is upright? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Blessed
is he that is born of woman and is short-lived. Be not profuse
in speech.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Let our praise be with God and not from ourselves;
for God hates those who praise themselves. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Let the testimony
to our good deeds be given by others, as it was given to our
upright forefathers. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Boldness and arrogance and audacity belong
to those who are cursed by God, gentleness and humility and
meekness are with those who are blessed by God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">31 </b>Let us, then, cling to his blessing, and let us see what the
ways to blessing are. Let us unroll the things that happened from
the beginning. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Why was our forefather Abraham blest? Was it
not because he attained uprightness and truth through faith?
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>With confidence Isaac knowing what would happen gladly let
himself be led to sacrifice. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Jacob with humility withdrew from his
country because of his brother, and went to Laban and served
him, and the twelve sceptres of the tribes of Israel were
given him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">32 </b>If one consider this sincerely in detail, he will recognize the
greatness of the gifts God has given. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For from Jacob come all
the priests and Levites that serve the altar of God. From him
physically the Lord Jesus came. From him came kings and rulers
and leaders in the line of Judah. And his other sceptres enjoy
no little glory, for God promised “Your posterity will be like
<span class="pb" id="page_65"><b class="pb">{Page 65}</b></span>
the stars of the sky.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So they were all glorified and magnified
not through themselves or their deeds nor through the uprightness
of their doings, but through his will. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So we too, who by his
will have been called in Christ Jesus are made upright not
through ourselves or through our wisdom or understanding or
piety or deeds we have done in holiness of heart, but through
faith, by which Almighty God has made all men upright from
the beginning; to him be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">33 </b>What are we to do then, brethren? Are we idly to refrain
from doing good and forsake love? May the Master never allow
that to happen to us at least, but let us hasten earnestly and
eagerly to perform every good deed. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the Creator and Master
of all things himself rejoices in his works. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For by his supreme
might he established the heavens and by his incomprehensible
understanding he organized them. He separated the earth from
the surrounding water, and established it upon the sure foundation
of his own will, and the animals that roam over it he called
into being by his own command. The sea and the creatures in it
he prepared and shut in by his own power. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Finally, with his
sacred and faultless hands he formed man, his pre-eminent and
greatest work, the impress of his own image. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For thus God
spoke: “Let us make man in our image and likeness. And God
made man, male and female he made them.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then when he had
finished all these things, he praised them and blessed them and
said, “Increase and multiply.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Let us observe that all the upright
have been adorned with good deeds, and the Lord himself
when he had adorned himself with good works rejoiced. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So having
this pattern let us accede to his will without delay, let us
do the work of uprightness with all our might.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">34 </b>The good workman boldly accepts the bread he has earned;
the lazy and careless one cannot look his employer in the face.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>So we must be eager to do right, for all things come from him.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>For he warns us, “Here comes the Lord, with his reward before
his face, to pay every man according to his work.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So he urges
<span class="pb" id="page_66"><b class="pb">{Page 66}</b></span>
us to believe in him with all our hearts, and not to be idle or
careless about any good work. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Let our glorying and our confidence
be in him. Let us be obedient to his will. Let us consider
how the whole multitude of his angels stand by and serve
his will. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For the scripture says, “Ten thousand times ten thousands
stood by him, and thousands of times ten thousand served
him, and they cried, ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, all
creation is full of his glory.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Let us too, therefore, gathered together
in conscious harmony, cry to him earnestly as with one
voice that we may share his great and glorious promises. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>For it
says, “No eye has seen and no ear heard, nor has the human
mind imagined the things that God has provided for those that
wait for him.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">35 </b>How blessed and wonderful the gifts of God are, dear friends!
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Life in immortality, splendour in uprightness, truth with boldness,
faith with confidence, self-control with sanctification, all
these things are within our understanding. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Then what are the
things that are being provided for those that wait for him? The
Creator and Father of the ages, the Most Holy One himself
knows their number and beauty. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Let us therefore strive to be
found in the number of those that wait for him, so that we may
share in the gifts he has promised. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But how shall this be, dear
friends? If our mind is fixed believingly on God, if we seek what
is pleasing and acceptable to him, if we perform acts that are in
harmony with his blameless will, and follow the way of truth,
casting from us all iniquity and wickedness, covetousness,
quarrelling, ill-nature and deceit, gossip, slander, hatred of
God, overbearingness and boastfulness, vain glory and inhospitality.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>For those that do these things are hateful to God, and
not only those that do them, but those that applaud them. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For
the scripture says, “But to the sinner God says, ‘Why do you
recount my statutes and take my covenant upon your lips? <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Yet
you hate instruction, and cast my words behind you! If you saw
a thief, you ran off with him, and you cast your lot with adulterers.
<span class="pb" id="page_67"><b class="pb">{Page 67}</b></span>
Your mouth increased evil, and your tongue wove deceit.
You sat and spoke evil of your brother, and you slandered your
mother’s son. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>You did these things, and I kept silent; you
thought, sinful man, that I would be like you! <sup class="verse">10 </sup>I will rebuke you
and set you before yourself.’ <sup class="verse">11 </sup>So consider these things, you who
forget God, that he may not seize you like a lion, and there be
no one to save you! <sup class="verse">12 </sup>The sacrifice of praise will glorify me, and
there is a way by which I will show him God’s deliverance.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">36 </b>This is the way, dear friends, by which we found our salvation,
Jesus Christ, the high priest of our offerings, the protector and
helper of our weakness. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Through him we fix our eyes on the
heights of heaven. In him we see mirrored God’s faultless and
sublime face; through him the eyes of our mind have been
opened, through him our foolish, darkened understanding springs
up to the light; through him the Master has willed that we should
taste immortal knowledge. He, being the reflection of God’s
majesty, is as much greater than angels as his title is superior to
theirs. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For thus it is written, “He who makes his angels winds,
and his attendants a flame of fire.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But of his Son, the Master
spoke thus, “You are my Son! I have today become your Father.
Ask me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance,
and the ends of the earth for your possession.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And again he says
to him, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your
footstool!” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Who, then, are his enemies? Those who are bad and
oppose his will.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">37 </b>Let us therefore, brethren, campaign most strenuously under
his faultless orders. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let us observe those who campaign under
our rulers,—with what discipline, subordination, and obedience
they execute their orders. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>They are not all generals or colonels
or captains or lieutenants, and so forth, but each one in his own
rank carries out the orders given by the emperor and the rulers.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>The great cannot exist without the small, nor the small without
the great. There is a kind of blending among all, and there is
an advantage in that. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Let us take our body; the head is nothing
<span class="pb" id="page_68"><b class="pb">{Page 68}</b></span>
without the feet, just as the feet are nothing without the head.
The smallest parts of our body are necessary and useful to the
whole body. But they all coalesce and experience a common submission,
in order to preserve the whole body.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">38 </b>So let our whole body be preserved through Christ Jesus, and
let each one be subject to his neighbor, as he has been placed by
his spiritual gift. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let the strong care for the weak, and let the
weak respect the strong. Let the rich provide for the poor, and
let the poor give thanks to God, because he has given him one
to supply his need. Let the wise man show his wisdom not in
words but in good deeds. Let the humble-minded not bear witness
to himself, but let himself have witness borne to him by
others. Let him that is pure in the flesh not boast of it, knowing
that it is another who bestows on him his self-control. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So let us
consider, brethren, of what matter we were made, who we are,
and what kind of beings we came into the world, from what a
dark grave he that formed and created us brought us into his
world, where he had prepared his benefits for us before we were
born. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Since therefore we have received all this from him we
ought to give him thanks for everything. To him be glory forever
and ever! Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">39 </b>Thoughtless, senseless, foolish, ignorant men mock and deride
us, wishing to exalt themselves in their imaginations. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For what
can a mortal man do? Or what strength has one who sprang from
the earth? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For it is written, “There was no form before my
eyes, but I heard a breeze and a voice, <sup class="verse">4 </sup>‘What! Can a mortal
be pure before the Lord? Or can a man be blameless for his
deeds, if he does not believe in his servants, and finds some wrong
in his angels? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Heaven is not clean in his sight; let alone, those
that live in houses of clay, of whom are we ourselves, made of
the same clay. He strikes them like a moth, and they do not
last from morning till evening. Because they cannot help themselves,
they perish. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>He breathes on them and they die, because
they have no wisdom.’ <sup class="verse">7 </sup>If you call now, will anyone answer
<span class="pb" id="page_69"><b class="pb">{Page 69}</b></span>
you, or will you see one of the holy angels? For wrath destroys
a foolish man, and jealousy puts to death one that is astray. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>I
have seen foolish men taking root, but their abode was immediately
eaten up. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>May their sons be far from safety, may they be
derided at the gates of their inferiors, with no one to deliver
them. For what has been prepared for them the upright will eat,
and they themselves will not be delivered from evil.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">40 </b>Now that these things are clear to us, and we have looked
into the depths of the divine knowledge we ought to do in due
order all the things the Master has commanded us to perform
at appointed times. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The sacrifices and services he has commanded
to be performed, and that it be not done unthinking or with
disorder, but at fixed times and hours. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Where and through whom
he wishes them to be performed he has himself determined
by his supreme will, in order that they all might be done
religiously with his approval and be acceptable to his will. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So
those that make their offerings at the appointed times are acceptable
and blessed, for since they follow the Master’s regulations
they cannot go wrong. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For the high priest has been given his
own special services, and the priests have been assigned their
own places and Levites have their particular duties. The layman
is bound by the rules for laymen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">41 </b>Let each one of us, brethren, please God in his own position,
with a good conscience, without going beyond the fixed rules
of his ministry, and with reverence. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Not everywhere, brethren,
but in Jerusalem alone are the perpetual sacrifices offered, or the
free-will offerings, or the sin and trespass offerings, and there,
they are not offered in every place, but at the altar before the
sanctuary, after the offering has been inspected by the high priest
and the attendants that have been mentioned. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So those that do
anything contrary to what conforms to his will incur the penalty
of death. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>You see, brethren, the greater the knowledge we have
been granted, the greater the risk we run.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_70"><b class="pb">{Page 70}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">42 </b>The apostles received the gospel for us from the Lord Jesus
Christ; Jesus the Christ was sent from God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So Christ is from
God, and the apostles from Christ. Both came to pass regularly
by the will of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So having received their instructions, and
having been reassured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
Christ, trusting in the word of God they set forth in the conviction
of the holy Spirit, preaching that the kingdom of God was
about to come. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So as they preached from country to country
and from town to town, they appointed their first converts, after
testing them by the Spirit, as superintendents and assistants,
of those who were to believe. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And this was no new thing; for
long before overseers and assistants had been written about.
For the scripture somewhere says, “I will appoint their superintendents
in uprightness and their assistants in faith.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">43 </b>And what wonder, if those who in Christ were entrusted with
such a task appointed those just mentioned? When the blessed
Moses, also, “a faithful servant in all his house,” noted down
in the sacred books all that had been enjoined upon him, being
followed by the rest of the prophets who bear witness with him
to his legislation. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when rivalry set in about the priesthood
and the tribes disagreed as to which of them was adorned with
the glorious title, he ordered the twelve tribal chiefs to bring
him staffs each marked with the name of a tribe, and he took
them and tied them together and stamped them with the seal
rings of the tribal chiefs, and he put them away in the Tent
of the Testimony on the table of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And he shut the Tent
and put the seals on the keys as well as the staffs, <sup class="verse">4 </sup>and he said to
them, “Brethren, the tribe whose staff buds is the one God has
chosen to be his priests and servants.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Early in the morning he
called all Israel together, six hundred thousand men, and he
showed the seals to the chiefs of the tribes and he opened the
Tent of the Testimony, and brought out the staffs, and Aaron’s
staff was found not only to have budded but to be bearing fruit.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>What do you think, dear friends? Did not Moses know beforehand
<span class="pb" id="page_71"><b class="pb">{Page 71}</b></span>
that this would happen? Of course he knew. But he did
this in order that there might be no disorder in Israel, that the
name of the True and Only One might be glorified. To him be
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">44 </b>Our apostles also knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there
would be contention for the title of overseer. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>On this account,
as they had received full foreknowledge they appointed those
already mentioned and later gave a supplement, in order that if
they should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed
to their duties. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Those therefore that were appointed by them,
or afterward by other reputable men with the consent of the
whole church, and have blamelessly served the flock of Christ,
humbly, quietly, and disinterestedly, and for a long time have
been universally approved—these men we consider are being
unjustly removed from their ministry. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For we shall be guilty
of no small sin if we depose from the position of overseer those
who have blamelessly and piously made the offerings. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Blessed
are the elders who have gone before, who experienced a fruitful
and perfect departure, for they have no need to fear that anyone
will remove them from their appointed place. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For we see that you
have dislodged some men who were conducting themselves well
from the ministry they had blamelessly respected.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">45 </b>Be emulous, brethren, and zealous about the things that relate
to salvation. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Study the holy scriptures, which are true, and given
by the holy Spirit. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Be sure that nothing wrong or made up is
written in them. You will not find that upright men have been
cast off by pious men. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Upright men were persecuted, but it was
by lawless men. They were thrown into prison, but by impious
men. They were stoned by transgressors. They were killed by
those that had conceived a depraved and unjust jealousy. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>In
suffering these things, they endured them nobly. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For what shall
we say, brethren? Was Daniel thrown into the den of lions by
men who feared God? <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Or were Ananias and Azariah and Mishael
shut up in the fiery furnace by those who practised the great
<span class="pb" id="page_72"><b class="pb">{Page 72}</b></span>
and glorious worship of the Most High? Certainly not! Who,
then, were the men that did these things? Detestable men, full
of all evil, reached such a pitch of factious fury that they inflicted
torture on men who were serving God with a pious and
blameless purpose, not knowing that the Most High is the
champion and defender of those who serve his most virtuous
name with a clear conscience; to him be glory forever and ever.
Amen. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>But those that trustingly endured attained glory and
honour; they were exalted and enrolled by God to be remembered
by him forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">46 </b>To such examples, brethren, we too must cling. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For it is written,
“Cling to those who are holy, for those who cling to them
will become holy.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And again in another place it says, “With a
guiltless man you will be guiltless, and with a chosen man you
will be chosen, and with a crooked man you will deal craftily.”
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>So let us cling to the guiltless and upright, for they are God’s
chosen. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Why is there quarrelling and anger and faction and division
and war among you? <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Have we not one God and one Christ
and one spirit of grace that has been poured out upon us? And
is there not one call through Christ? <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Why do we tear apart
and rend the parts of Christ and revolt against our own body,
and reach such a height of folly that we forget that we are
parts of one another? Remember the words of our Lord Jesus,
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>for he said, “Alas for that man! It would have been better for
him if he had never been born than to make one of my chosen
fall! He might better have had a millstone hung around his
neck and have been sunk in the sea than to pervert one of my
chosen.” <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Your division has perverted many, it has plunged many
into despondency, many into doubt, all of us into grief, and your
rebellion still continues.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">47 </b>Take up the letter of the blessed Paul, the apostle. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>What
did he first write to you, in the beginning of the preaching
of the gospel? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Certainly he wrote you under the Spirit’s influence
about himself and Cephas and Apollos, for even then you had
<span class="pb" id="page_73"><b class="pb">{Page 73}</b></span>
formed parties. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But those parties involved you in less sin, for
you were partisans of apostles of repute and of a man of whom
they approved. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But now think who have misled you and lessened
the repute of your far famed brotherly love. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>It is disgraceful,
dear friends, utterly disgraceful, and unworthy of Christian conduct
to have it said that because of one or two people the old,
established church of the Corinthians is in revolt against its
elders. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And this report has not only reached us but also those
who differ from us, so that because of your folly the name of
the Lord is reviled and you yourselves are imperilled.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">48 </b>Let us therefore make haste to put a stop to this, and let us
fall down before the Master and implore him with tears to have
mercy upon us and be reconciled to us, and restore us to our
reverent and pure attitude of brotherly love. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For it is a gate of
uprightness opening into life, as it is written, “Open for me
the gates of uprightness; I will go in by them and thank the
Lord. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>This is the gate of the Lord; the upright will go in by
it.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So, while many gates stand open, the gate of uprightness
is the gate of Christ; blessed are all those that go in by it, and
direct their course in holiness and uprightness, calmly accomplishing
everything. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Let a man be faithful, let him be able to
utter knowledge, let him be wise in his interpretation of what is
said, let him be pure in conduct; <sup class="verse">6 </sup>the greater he seems to be,
the more humble-minded he should be, and the more disposed
to seek not his own advantage but that of all.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">49 </b>Let him who in union with Christ has love, keep Christ’s commandments.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Who can describe the bond of the love of God? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Who
is equal to expressing the greatness of its beauty? <sup class="verse">4 </sup>The height to
which love lifts us is inexpressible. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Love unites us to God, love
covers up a host of sins, love will bear anything, it is patient
about everything. There is nothing vulgar, nothing vain, about
love. Love knows no schism, love creates no discord, love does
everything in harmony. By love all God’s chosen have been made
perfect. Without love nothing can please God. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>In love the Master
<span class="pb" id="page_74"><b class="pb">{Page 74}</b></span>
took us to himself. Because of the love he had for us, Jesus
Christ our Lord by the will of God gave his blood for us, and
his flesh for our flesh, and his life for our lives.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">50 </b>You see, dear friends, how great and wonderful love is, and
there is no describing its perfection. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Who is fit to be found in it
except those whom God deems worthy? So let us pray and beg
of his mercy that we may be found in love, irreproachable, free
from human partiality. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>All the generations from Adam until
this day have passed away, but those who by God’s favour have
been made perfect in love live in the abode of the godly, and
they will be made manifest at the visitation of the kingdom of
Christ. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For it is written, “Go into your chambers for a little while,
until my wrath and anger pass, and I will remember a good
day, and will raise you up from your graves.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>How happy we
are, dear friends, if we carry out the commandments of God in
the harmony of love, that our sins may be forgiven through
love. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For it is written, “How happy they are whose iniquities are
forgiven and whose sins are covered up. How happy the man is
whose sin the Lord will take no account of, and in whose mouth
there is no deceit.” <sup class="verse">7 </sup>This blessing has come to those who have
been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">51 </b>So for the things which we have gone astray and done through
any intrusions of the adversary let us pray that we be forgiven.
And those also who have been the instigators of dissension and
division ought to have regard for the common hope. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For those
who live in fear and love had rather suffer tortures themselves
than have their neighbours do so, and they had rather bear condemnation
themselves than have the harmony condemned which
has been honourably and uprightly handed down to us. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For it is
better for a man to acknowledge his transgressions than to harden
his heart, as the heart of those was hardened who rebelled against
Moses the servant of God. Their condemnation was made plain.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>For “they went down alive into Hades” and “death will shepherd
<span class="pb" id="page_75"><b class="pb">{Page 75}</b></span>
them.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Pharaoh and his host and all the rulers of Egypt, “the
chariots and their riders,” were engulfed in the Red Sea and
perished for no other reason than that their foolish hearts were
hardened after the signs and wonders had occurred in Egypt
through God’s servant Moses.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">52 </b>The Master, brethren, is in no need of anything; he wants nothing
of anyone but to give thanks to him. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For David the chosen
says, “I will give thanks to the Lord, and it will please him
more than a young calf with horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it
and rejoice.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And again he says, “Offer to God the sacrifice of
praise, and pay your vows to the Most High, and call upon me
in the day of your affliction and I will deliver you, and you
will glorify me.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For “the sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">53 </b>For you know the sacred scriptures, dear friends, you know
them well, and you have studied the oracles of God. So I write
these things to remind you of them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when Moses went up on
the mountain and spent forty days and forty nights in fasting and
self-abasement, God said to him, “Go down quickly from here,
for your people, whom you have brought out of the land of
Egypt, have disobeyed; they have quickly gone astray from the
way you commanded them to follow, they have cast idols for
themselves.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the Lord said to him, “I have spoken to you
once and again saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is
stiff-necked; let me exterminate them, and wipe out their name
from under heaven, and I will make you a great, wonderful
nation, much larger than this one.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And Moses said, “By no
means, Lord! Forgive this people their sin, or wipe me also out
of the book of the living.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>What great love! What unsurpassable
perfection! The servant speaks freely to his Lord, he begs forgiveness
for the multitude, or asks that he too be wiped out
along with them.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">54 </b>Who, then, among you is noble? Who is compassionate?
Who is full of love? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let him say, “If on my account disorder
and quarrelling and divisions have arisen, I will leave, I will
<span class="pb" id="page_76"><b class="pb">{Page 76}</b></span>
go wherever you wish, and do whatever the majority commands;
only let the flock of Christ be at peace with its appointed
elders.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The man who does this will win himself great renown in
Christ, and every place will welcome him, for “the earth is the
Lord’s and its fullness.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>This is what those who follow the divine
way of life that brings no regrets have done and will do.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">55 </b>To offer some examples from the heathen also, many kings
and rulers, in times of pestilence, in response to an oracle have
given themselves up to death in order by their own blood to
save their townsmen. Many have removed from their own cities,
so that they would rebel no more. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>We know that many among
us have given themselves up to bondage in order to ransom others.
Many have given themselves up to slavery and used the price
paid for themselves to feed others. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Many women, strengthened
by the favour of God, have done heroic deeds. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>The blessed Judith,
when the city was besieged, asked the elders to permit her to
go out to the camp of the foreigners. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So she exposed herself to
danger and went out for her love of country and of her besieged
people, and the Lord delivered Holophernes into a woman’s hand.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>To no less danger Esther also, in perfect faith, exposed herself,
in order to save the twelve tribes of Israel when they were on the
point of perishing, for by fasting and humiliation she implored the
all-seeing Master, the God of the ages, and he, seeing her
humility of soul, delivered the people for whom she had faced
danger.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">56 </b>So let us also intercede for those involved in any transgression,
that forbearance and humility may be granted them, so that they
may submit, not to us, but to the will of God. For so they will
have a fruitful and perfect remembrance with compassion, in the
sight of God and his people. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let us accept correction, dear
friends, over which no one should feel annoyed. The warning that
we address to one another is good and extremely beneficial, for
it unites us to the will of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For the holy word says, “The
Lord has disciplined me severely, and he has not given me up to
<span class="pb" id="page_77"><b class="pb">{Page 77}</b></span>
death. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For it is he whom the Lord loves that he disciplines, and
he chastises every son that he acknowledges. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For the upright,”
it says, “will discipline me in mercy and reprove me, but let not
the oil of sinners anoint my head.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And again it says, “How
happy the man is whom the Lord reproves; do not refuse the
warning of the Almighty; for he causes pain, and restores again;
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>he strikes, and his hands heal. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Six times he will rescue you from
distress, and the seventh time, no harm will befall you. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>In famine
he will deliver you from death, and in war he will free you from
the power of the sword. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>He will hide you from the scourge of the
tongue, and when evils come you will not be afraid. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>You will
laugh at unrighteous and lawless men, and you will not be
afraid of wild beasts. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>For wild animals will be at peace with you.
<sup class="verse">13 </sup>Then you will know that your house will be in peace, and the life
of your tent will not fail. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>And you will know that your posterity
will be many, and your children like all the herbage of the
field. <sup class="verse">15 </sup>And you will come to the grave like ripe wheat harvested
in season, or like a heap on the threshing floor gathered together
at the right time.” <sup class="verse">16 </sup>You see, dear friends, what protection is given
those who are disciplined by the Master, for as a good father he
disciplines us so that through his holy discipline we may receive
mercy.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">57 </b>You therefore who laid the foundation of the disorder must
submit to the elders and be disciplined so as to repent, bending
the knees of your hearts. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Learn to subordinate yourselves, laying
aside the boastful and haughty wilfulness of your tongue, for
it is better for you to occupy a small but reputable place in the
flock of Christ than while seeming to be pre-eminent to be cast
out of your hope of him. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For this is what the most excellent
Wisdom says: “Behold, I will utter to you the speech of my
Spirit, and will teach you my word. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Because I called and you
would not obey, and I put forth words and you paid no heed,
but made my counsels futile and disobeyed my reproofs, therefore
I will laugh at your ruin, I will exult when destruction
<span class="pb" id="page_78"><b class="pb">{Page 78}</b></span>
comes upon you and when confusion suddenly overtakes you,
and catastrophe comes like a whirlwind, or when persecution or
siege befalls you. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For it shall be, when you call upon me, that
I will not listen to you; the evil will seek me and they will not
find me. For they hated wisdom, and did not choose the fear of
the Lord, and they would not heed my counsels, but mocked
my reproofs. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Therefore they will eat the fruits of their own way,
and be filled with their own impiety. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For because they wronged
infants they will be slain, and examination will destroy the
ungodly. But he who listens to me will live secure in his hope,
and will be quiet with no fear of any evil.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">58 </b>Let us, then, obey his most holy and glorious name, and escape
the threats uttered long ago by Wisdom against the disobedient,
so that we may pitch our tents trusting in the most sacred name
of his majesty. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Take our advice, and you will not regret it. For
as God lives, and the Lord Jesus Christ lives, and the holy Spirit,
who are the faith and hope of God’s chosen, the man who humbly,
with constant forbearance, and without cause for regret carries
out the decrees and commands ordained by God, will be registered
and enrolled in the number of those who are saved through Jesus
Christ, through whom is glory to him forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">59 </b>But if any disobey what has been said by him through us, let
them know that they will involve themselves in no slight transgression
and danger. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But we will be guiltless of this sin, and we
will ask with earnest prayer and supplication that the Creator of
all may keep unbroken the number that has been counted of his
chosen in all the world through his beloved child Jesus Christ,
through whom he called us from darkness to light, from ignorance
to the recognition of the glory of his name, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>to hope in your name,
which is the source of all creation, opening the eyes of our mind
to know you, who alone are most high among the highest,
remaining holy among the holy, who humble the insolence of the
haughty, who destroy the calculations of the heathen, who set
the humble on high and bring the lofty low, who make rich
<span class="pb" id="page_79"><b class="pb">{Page 79}</b></span>
and make poor, who kill and make alive, the only benefactor of
spirits, and God of all flesh, who look into the abysses, the
observer of the works of man, the helper of those in peril, the
saviour of those in despair, creator and guardian of every spirit;
who multiply nations on the earth and have chosen from all men
those that love thee through Jesus Christ your beloved child,
through whom you have trained, sanctified, and honoured us.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>We beseech you, Master, to be our helper and protector. Save
those of us who are in affliction. Lift up the fallen, show yourself
to those in need, cure the sick, bring back those of your people
who have gone astray, feed the hungry, release those of us who
are in prison, raise up the weak, encourage the fainthearted.
Let all the heathen know that you alone are God, and Jesus
Christ is your child, and we are “your people, and the sheep of
your pasture.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">60 </b>For you through your operations have revealed the everlasting
constitution of the universe; you, Lord, created the world. You
who are faithful in all generations, upright in judgments,
wonderful in might and majesty, wise in creating and intelligent
in establishing existing things, good in the visible world
and kind to those that trust in you, merciful and compassionate,
forgive us our sins and wrongdoings and transgressions and failings.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Do not take account of every sin of your slaves and maid-servants,
but cleanse us with the cleansing of your truth and
direct our steps to walk in holiness of heart, and to do what is
right and well-pleasing before you and before our rulers. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Yes,
Lord, make your face shine upon us in peace for our good, that
we may be shielded by your mighty hand, and delivered from
every sin by your uplifted arm, and deliver us from those that
hate us wrongfully. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Grant harmony and peace to us and to all
who inhabit the earth, as you gave it to our fathers, when they
called upon you reverently in faith and truth—being made
obedient to your almighty and glorious name and to our rulers
and governors on earth.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_80"><b class="pb">{Page 80}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">61 </b>You, Master, have given them the authority to reign through
your transcendent and unutterable might that we may recognize
the glory and honour given them by you, and be subject to them,
offering no opposition to your will. Grant, Lord, to them health,
peace, harmony, stability, so that they may without offence conduct
the government you have given them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For you, heavenly
Master, king, of the ages, give the sons of men glory and honour
and authority over those who are on the earth. Lord, direct their
counsel by what is right and pleasing in your sight, so that,
piously administering in peace and gentleness the authority you
have given them, they may experience your mercy. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>You who
alone are able to do these good things and far more abundantly
for us, we praise you through the high priest and guardian of our
souls, Jesus Christ, through whom be glory and majesty to you,
both now and for all generations and forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">62 </b>About the things that befit our religion and are most helpful
to those who wish to direct their way piously and uprightly to
a virtuous life, brethren, we have written you enough. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For we
have handled every subject relating to faith, repentance, genuine
love, self-control, sober-mindedness, and patience, reminding you
that you must please Almighty God with holiness, in uprightness
and truth and long-suffering in a life of concord, without malice,
in love and peace, with earnest forbearance, as our forefathers
already mentioned pleased him, with their humility toward their
Father and God and Creator and toward all men. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And we have
been more glad to remind you of these things because we knew
well that we were writing to men who were faithful and of high
repute and who had studied the oracles of God’s teaching.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">63 </b>It is right therefore that admitting such numerous examples
we should bow our necks and take the attitude of obedience,
so that suspending our futile disorder we may without any blame
reach the goal set before us in truth. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For you will cause us joy
and gladness if you are obedient to what we have written through
the holy Spirit, and uproot the abominable anger of your jealousy,
<span class="pb" id="page_81"><b class="pb">{Page 81}</b></span>
in response to the entreaty for peace and harmony that we
have made in this letter. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And we send faithful, thoughtful men,
who have lived among us blamelessly from youth to old age,
who will be witnesses between you and us. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>We do this so that
you may know that our whole concern has been and still is that
you may speedily be at peace.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">64 </b>Finally, may the all-seeing God and Master of spirits and Lord
of all flesh, who chose the Lord Jesus Christ, and us through
him for his own people, give to every soul that is called by his
excellent and holy name, faith, fear, peace, patience, and long-suffering,
self-control, purity and sober-mindedness, so that they
may be well-pleasing to his name through our high priest and
defender Jesus Christ, through whom unto him be glory and
majesty, might and honour, both now and forever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">65 </b>Send back quickly to us in peace and with joy the men sent
from us, Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Bito, together with
Fortunatus, so that they may the sooner bring word of your peace
and harmony, so prayed for and longed for by us, so that we
too may the sooner rejoice in your tranquillity.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you and with all
men everywhere who have been called by God and through him,
through whom to him be glory, honour, might and majesty,
eternal dominion, from ages past forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h2>The So-called Second Letter of Clement</h2>

<p>II Clement is a Christian sermon, probably of Roman origin,
written about A.D. 150 to 165. It came to the attention of Western
learning with the coming to England in 1628 of the Codex
Alexandrinus, in which it immediately follows I Clement, which
is designated as the “first letter of Clement.” But Eusebius long
before had mentioned it doubtfully as the Second Letter of
Clement, <i>Church History</i> 3.38.4. No more probable explanation
of the document has been offered than that it is a sermon of Soter,
Bishop of Rome, A.D. 166-174, sent as a letter to the church at
Corinth, and acknowledged by Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, in
a well-known letter preserved in Eusebius (<i>Church History</i>
4.23.11). Dionysius says that the Corinthian church will preserve
Soter’s letter, and read it from time to time, and be able to draw
advice from it, “as also from the former epistle which was written
to us through Clement.” This would explain the preservation of
the homily as a companion of I Clement, both documents having
been written at Rome and sent to the church at Corinth.</p>

<p>The sermon is an appeal to its hearers to repent and serve
God with their whole hearts, to live upright lives, and hold fast
to their resurrection hope. It shows acquaintance not only with
the four Gospels and the Letters of Paul, but with I Peter, the
Gospel of the Egyptians (A.D. 130-140), and a mysterious prophetical
book, also quoted in I Clement, which may be the lost
Book of Eldad and Modat, mentioned in Hermas (Vis. ii.3.4) and
evidently known and read in Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_84"><b class="pb">{Page 84}</b></span></p>

<p>II Clement accompanied I Clement not only into the closing
pages of the New Testament in the Codex Alexandrinus, but
found a place with it in one Harclean Syriac New Testament
manuscript, of the twelfth century. They are mentioned as belonging
to the New Testament in the <i>Apostolic Canons</i>, a Syrian
book of about A.D. 400, and Abu’l Barakat (†1363) in telling of
Christian literature in Arabic speaks of them as in the New Testament.</p>

<h2>The So-called Second Letter of Clement</h2>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Brethren, we must think of Jesus Christ, as we do of God, as
the judge of living and dead, and we must not think lightly
of our salvation. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when we think little of him, we also hope
to receive little. And those who listen as though to small matters
sin, and we sin, not knowing whence we were called, and by
whom, and to what place, and what sufferings Jesus Christ endured
for us. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>What return, then, can we make to him, or what
fruit can we offer worthy of his gift to us? How many blessings
do we owe to him? <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For he has given us the light, as a Father
he has acknowledged us as sons, he saved us when we were perishing.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>What praise, then, can we give him, or what repayment
for what we have received? <sup class="verse">6 </sup>We were blind in mind, worshipping
stone and wood and gold and silver and bronze, the works
of men, and our whole life was nothing but death. So when we
were enveloped in darkness, with our sight so full of mist, we
received our sight back, and laid aside by his will the cloud that
enveloped us. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For he has taken pity on us, and mercifully saved
us, seeing in us our great error and ruin, and that we had no
hope of salvation except from him. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>For he called us when we
were no more, and from not being he willed that we should
come to be.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“Rejoice, barren woman, who have had no children; break
forth and shout, you who have not borne, for the desolate woman
has more children than the one that has the husband.” When he
<span class="pb" id="page_86"><b class="pb">{Page 86}</b></span>
said, “Rejoice, barren woman, who have had no children,” he
meant us, for our church was barren before she was given children.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>And when he said, “Shout, you who have not borne,” he
meant this: let us not grow weary, like women in childbirth, in
offering our prayers to God in sincerity. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And when he said, “For
the desolate woman has more children than the one that has the
husband,” it was because our people seemed to be deserted by
God, but now that we have believed we have become more
numerous than those who seemed to have God. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And another
scripture says, “I did not come to invite the upright but the
irreligious.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>This means that those who are perishing must be
saved. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For it is great and wonderful to strengthen not what
is standing up but what is falling down. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So Christ also wished
to save what was perishing, and saved many, coming and calling
us just as we were perishing.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>Since he has shown us such mercy, first that we who are living
do not sacrifice to those dead gods, and do not worship them,
but through him have come to know the Father of truth, what
is knowledge with reference to him if it is not refusing to deny
him through whom we have come to know him? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And he himself
says, “Everyone that acknowledges me before men I will acknowledge
before my Father.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>This, then, is our reward, if we acknowledge
him through whom we were saved. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But how shall we
acknowledge him? By doing what he says, and not disregarding
his commands, and honouring him not only with our lips, but
with our whole hearts and our whole minds. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For it says in Isaiah,
“This people honours me with their lips, yet their hearts are far
away from me.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Let us therefore not only call him Lord, for that will not save
us. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For he says, “It is not everyone who says to me ‘Lord! Lord!’
who will be saved, but he who acts uprightly.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So then, brethren,
let us acknowledge him with our acts, by loving one another,
by not committing adultery or speaking evil of one another, or
being jealous, but by being self-controlled, merciful, kind. And
<span class="pb" id="page_87"><b class="pb">{Page 87}</b></span>
we ought to be sympathetic with one another and not to love
money. By these actions let us acknowledge him, and not by
their opposites. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And we must not fear men more, but God. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Because
of this, if you do these things, the Lord said, “Even if you
are gathered with me in my bosom, but do not do my commands,
I will cast you off and say to you, Go away from me, I do not
know whence you come, you doers of iniquity.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Therefore, brethren, let us turn our backs on our stay in this
world, and do the will of him who has called us, and let us not
be afraid to go out of this world. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the Lord says, “You will
be like lambs among wolves.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But Peter answered and said to
him, “What if the wolves tear the lambs to pieces?” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Jesus said
to Peter, “Let the lambs have no fear of the wolves after their
death, and do not you fear those who kill you and can do nothing
more to you, but fear him who after you are dead has power
over soul and body to cast them into the fiery pit.” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>You must
know, brethren, that our stay in this material world is small and
short, but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful; it is rest
in the kingdom that is coming and in eternal life. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>What, then,
must we do to obtain them but lead a holy and upright life and
think of the things of this world as not our own, and not desire
them? <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For when we desire to get these things, we miss the way
of uprightness.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>And the Lord says, “No servant can serve two masters.” If
we want to serve both God and money, it is unprofitable for
us. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>“For what good does it do a man to gain the whole world,
and yet part with his life?” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>This world and the world to come
are two enemies. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>This world means adultery and corruption,
and avarice and deceit, and that world bids these things goodbye.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>So we cannot be friends of both; we must bid this one
good-bye to enjoy the other. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>We think it is better to hate what
is here, for it is little and short-lived and perishable, and to
love what is there, which is good and imperishable. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For if we
do the will of Christ, we will find rest, but if we do not, nothing
<span class="pb" id="page_88"><b class="pb">{Page 88}</b></span>
can save us from eternal punishment, if we disregard his commands.
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>And the scripture also says in Ezekiel, “If Noah, Job
and Daniel rise, they will not save their descendants in the
captivity.” <sup class="verse">9 </sup>But if even such upright men cannot by their uprightness
save their descendants, what assurance have we, if we do
not keep our baptism pure and undefiled, of entering the kingdom
of God? Or who will be our advocate, if we are not found
to have holy and upright works?</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>So then, my brethren, let us take part in the contest, knowing
that the contest is at hand, and that many are arriving by sea
for the corruptible contests, but that not all will be crowned,
but only those who have worked hard and competed well. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So
let us compete, so that we may all be crowned victors. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So let
us run the straight course, the incorruptible contest, and let many
of us sail to it, and compete, in order that we also may be
crowned victors, and if we cannot all be crowned victors, let
us at least come near the wreath. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>We must know that if one
who competes in the corruptible contest is caught cheating, he
is flogged and removed, and thrown out of the stadium. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>What do
you think? What will be done with the man who cheats in the
competition for the incorruptible? <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For of those who have not
kept the seal of baptism, it says, “Their worm shall not die, and
their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a spectacle
for all flesh.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>So while we are on earth, let us repent. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For we are clay in
the hand of the workman. For just as the potter, if he is making
a dish, and it becomes misshaped or broken in his hands, models
it over again, but if he goes so far as to put it into the firing
furnace, he cannot mend it any more, so let us also while we
are in this world repent with all our hearts of the wicked things
we have done in the flesh, so that we may be saved by the Lord,
while we still have time to repent. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For after we leave the world,
we can there no longer confess or repent any more. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Therefore,
brethren, if we do the Father’s will, and keep the flesh pure,
and keep the Lord’s commands, we shall receive eternal life. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For
<span class="pb" id="page_89"><b class="pb">{Page 89}</b></span>
the Lord says in the gospel, “If you have not guarded the small,
who will give you what is great? For I tell you, the man who can
be trusted in a very small matter can be trusted in a large one.”
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>What he means, then, is this, Keep the flesh pure and the seal
of baptism unstained, so that we may receive eternal life.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>And let none of you say that the flesh is not judged and does
not rise again. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You must know: in what state were you saved?
In what did you regain your sight, if not when you were in this
flesh? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So we must guard the flesh as a temple of God. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For just
as you were called in the flesh, you will also come in the flesh.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>If Christ the Lord who saved us, though he was at first spirit,
became flesh and in that state called us, so we also will receive
our recompense in this flesh. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So let us love one another, so that
we may all enter the kingdom of God. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>While we have the opportunity
to be cured, let us entrust ourselves to God, the physician,
and give him his compensation. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>What compensation?
Repentance from a sincere heart. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>For he has foreknowledge of all
things, and knows what is in our hearts. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>So let us give him praise,
not only with our lips but from our hearts, so that he may welcome
us as sons. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>For the Lord said, “These who do the will of
my Father are my brothers.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Therefore, my brethren, let us do the will of the Father who
has called us, so that we may live, and let us prefer the pursuit
of virtue; but let us give up evil, as a forerunner of our sins,
and let us flee from ungodliness, so that evil may not overtake us.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if we are eager to do good, peace will pursue us. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>This is
why it is impossible for men to find peace, when they introduce
the fears of men, and prefer enjoyment here to what is promised
for the future. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For they do not know what great torment their
enjoyment here will bring, and what enjoyment the promise of
what is to come will bring. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And if they did these things by themselves,
it might be home, but as it is they keep teaching evil to
innocent souls, not aware that they will receive a double sentence,
for both themselves and their hearers.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart, and we shall
<span class="pb" id="page_90"><b class="pb">{Page 90}</b></span>
be upright; but if because we do not believe God’s promise, we
do not serve him, we shall be miserable. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the prophetic word
says, “How miserable the double-minded are, who doubt in their
minds, and say, ‘We heard this long ago, even in the times of our
forefathers, and though we have waited day after day we have
seen none of them.’ <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Senseless people! Compare yourselves to a
tree; take a vine. First it sheds its leaves, then a shoot appears,
afterward a sour grape, then a ripe grape. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So my people also
has had disturbances and afflictions; then it will receive blessings.”
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>Therefore, my brethren, let us not waver, but let us hope
and endure, so that we may also receive our recompense. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>“For
he is faithful who has promised” to give each man his compensation
for his work. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So if we do uprightness before God, we will
enter his kingdom and receive the promises, “which no eye has
seen, and no ear heard, nor has the human mind imagined.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>Let us therefore from hour to hour wait in love and uprightness
for the kingdom of God, since we do not know the day when
God will appear. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the Lord himself, when he was asked by
someone when his kingdom would come, said, “When the two
shall be one, and the outside like the inside, and the male with
the female neither male nor female.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Now the two are one, when
we tell one another the truth, and in two persons there is one
soul, with no dissimulation. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And “the outside like the inside”
means this: the inside means the soul, and the outside means
the body. So just as your body is visible, let your soul also be
manifest in its good actions. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And “the male with the female
neither male nor female” means this: that a brother when he sees
a sister should not think of her at all as female, nor she think
of him at all as male. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>When you do this, he says, my Father’s
kingdom will come.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>So, brethren, let us now at last repent. Let us be vigilant for
the good, for we are full of much folly and wickedness. Let us
wipe off from us our former sins, and let us repent with our
whole hearts and be saved. And let us not try to please men,
<span class="pb" id="page_91"><b class="pb">{Page 91}</b></span>
or wish to please only ourselves, but also the outsiders, by our
uprightness, in order that the name may not be reproached because
of us. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the Lord says, “My name is continually reproached
among all the heathen,” and again, “Woe to the man
because of whom my name is reproached.” Why is it reproached?
Because you do not do what I want. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For when the heathen hear
from our mouths the oracles of God, they wonder at them as
beautiful and great; but afterward when they find out that what
we do is unworthy of the things we say, they turn from it
and revile it, declaring it a myth and a delusion. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For when they
hear us say that God says, “It is no merit in you if you love those
who love you, but you have merit if you love your enemies and
those who hate you”—when they hear that, they wonder at such
extraordinary goodness; but when they see that not only do we
not love those who hate us but not even those who love us, they
laugh at us, and the name is reviled.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>Therefore, brethren, if we do the will of God our Father, we
shall belong to the first church, that spiritual one, that was
created before the sun and moon; but if we do not do the Lord’s
will, we shall be of those meant by the scripture that says,
“My house has become a robbers’ cave.” So, then, let us choose
to be part of the church of life, in order that we may be saved.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>I do not suppose you are unaware that a living “church is the
body of Christ”; for the scripture says, “God made man male and
female.” The male is Christ, the female is the church. Besides,
the books and the apostles say that the church not only exists
now, but has done so from the beginning. For she was spiritual
as our Jesus also was, but he was revealed in the last days, to
save us. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the church, which was spiritual, was revealed in
the flesh of Christ, showing us that if any of us guards her in
the flesh and does not corrupt her, he will get her back again
in the holy Spirit. For this flesh is a copy of the spirit. No one
therefore who has spoiled the copy will share in the original.
So what he means is this, brethren: preserve the flesh, so that
<span class="pb" id="page_92"><b class="pb">{Page 92}</b></span>
you may share in the spirit. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But if we say that the flesh is the
church and the spirit is Christ, then the man who outrages the
flesh outrages the church. Such a man therefore will not share in
the spirit which is Christ. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Such is the life and immortality this
flesh can share in, if it is joined to the holy Spirit, and no one
can say or tell what the Lord has prepared for his chosen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>I think I have given no little advice about self-control, and
anyone who takes it will have no cause to regret it, but will save
both himself and me who have given it to him. For it is no small
remuneration to convert a soul that is astray and perishing. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For
this is the recompense we can pay to God who created us, if
the man who speaks and the man who hears speak and bear
with faith and love. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us therefore in uprightness and holiness
stand by the things we have believed, in order that we may ask
with confidence of God, who says, “Even while you are speaking,
I will say, ‘Here I am.’” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For this saying is an indication of a
great promise; for the Lord means that he is more ready to give
than a man is to ask. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So let us avail ourselves of such kindness
and not begrudge ourselves the obtaining of such blessings. For
however much pleasure these words bring to those who do them,
they mean just as much condemnation for those who disregard
them.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>Therefore, brethren, since we have been given no small opportunity
to repent, let us while we have time turn to God who
has called us, while we still have one who is ready to receive
us. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if we bid these luxuries good-bye and win the victory
over our souls by not carrying out its evil desires, we shall share
in the mercy of Jesus. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But be assured that the day of judgment
is already coming like a burning oven, and some of the heavens
will melt, and all the earth will be like lead melting in the fire,
and then the secret and the open doings of men will appear.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Therefore charity is good, as well as repentance for sin; fasting
is better than prayer, but charity than both. Love covers up a
host of sins, but prayer with a good conscience delivers from
<span class="pb" id="page_93"><b class="pb">{Page 93}</b></span>
death. Blessed is every man who is found full of these, for
charity removes the load of sin.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">17 </b>Let us therefore repent with all our hearts, so that none of us
may perish to no purpose. For if we have commands to do this
also, to drag men away from idols and instruct them, how much
more it is not right that a soul that already knows God should
perish! <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So let us help one another to restore those also who are
weak in goodness, in order that we may all be saved, and convert
and warn one another. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And let us not only seem to believe and
give heed now, while we are being exhorted by the elders, but
also when we get home let us remember the Lord’s commands
and not be dragged the other way by worldly passions, but let us
come here more frequently and try to progress in the Lord’s commands,
in order that all of us may live in harmony and be
gathered together to life. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For the Lord said, “I am coming to
gather all the nations, tribes and languages.” This means the
day of his appearing, when he will come and redeem us, each
according to what he has done. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And the unbelievers “will see
his glory” and power, and they will be amazed when they see
the sovereignty of the world in the hands of Jesus, and say,
“Alas for us, for it was you, and we did not know it and did not
believe, and did not obey the elders when they brought us news
of our salvation.” And “their worm shall not die, nor shall their
fire be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle for all mankind.”
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>He means that day of judgment, when men will see those who
lived ungodly lives among us and distorted the commands of
Jesus Christ. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But the upright who have done right and endured
torture and hated the indulgences of the soul, when they see how
those who have gone astray and denied Jesus by their words or
by their acts are punished with dreadful tortures in unquenchable
fire, will give glory to their God, saying, “There will be hope
for him who has served God with all his heart.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">18 </b>Let us also therefore be of those who give thanks, those who
have served God, and not of the ungodly who are judged. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For
<span class="pb" id="page_94"><b class="pb">{Page 94}</b></span>
I myself too who am utterly sinful and have not yet escaped
temptation, but am still in the midst of the devil’s tools, am
eager to pursue righteousness, in order that I may succeed
at least in getting close to it, in fear of the judgment that is
to come.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">19 </b>Therefore, brothers and sisters, after the God of truth (the
scripture lesson), I have read you an appeal to give heed to what
is written, so that you may save yourselves and him that does
the reading before you. For as recompense I ask you to repent
with all your hearts and give yourselves salvation and life. For
if we do this, we shall set up a mark for all the youth who wish
to devote themselves to piety and the goodness of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And
let us, unwise as we are, not be displeased or take it ill when
someone warns us and tries to turn us from unrighteousness to
uprightness. For sometimes when we do wrong we do not know
it, because of the doubt and unbelief that are in our breasts,
and we are darkened in understanding by vain desires. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us
therefore practise uprightness, so that we may finally be saved.
Blessed are they that obey these commands; even though they
are ill-treated a little while in this world, they will gather the
immortal fruit of the resurrection. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So the godly man must not
grieve if he is miserable in these present times; a time of happiness
is awaiting him; he will live again above, with his forefathers,
and rejoice through an eternity free from sorrow.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">20 </b>But do not let it trouble your minds that we see the unrighteous
possessing wealth and the slaves of God in difficulties.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let us therefore have faith, brothers and sisters. We are taking
part in the contest of a living God, and we are being trained
by the present life so that we may win the wreath in the life
that is to come. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>None of the upright has received his fruit
quickly, but waits for it. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For if God paid the recompense of the
upright promptly, we should immediately be engaged in business,
not religion, for we should pretend to be upright when we were
pursuing not religion but gain. For that reason the judgment
<span class="pb" id="page_95"><b class="pb">{Page 95}</b></span>
of God overtakes a Spirit that is not upright, and loads it with
chains.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>To the only God, invisible, Father of truth, who sent forth
to us the Saviour and prince of immortality, through whom
he has shown us the truth and the heavenly life—to him be
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h2>The Shepherd of Hermas</h2>

<p>The last decade of the first century witnessed the writing not
only of the Revelation of John at Patmos, near Ephesus, but of
a second Christian revelation, <i>The Shepherd of Hermas</i>, at Rome.
Hermas was a Christian prophet, and was clearly acquainted
with the Revelation of John, but its literary influence upon him
was very slight, Vision iv.2.1. The book that had most definitely
stirred him to write is the so-called Letter to the Hebrews, a
message sent to Home about A.D. 95, which roused the Roman
church to do its duty in teaching the other churches, 5.12, through
I Clement and I Peter, and now moved Hermas to write, by its
stern doctrine of no forgiveness for apostasy, which he understood
to mean no forgiveness for sin after baptism. Hermas maintains
that a Christian may fall into sin once after baptism and
be forgiven once, but only once. He casts his message chiefly in
the form of interviews with the angel of repentance (the Shepherd,
as he calls him), a form of revelation much like that in the
Ezra Apocalypse in II Esdras, where Ezra questions the angel
Uriel and records his answers. We cannot suppose that Hermas
knew that Hebrew apocalypse, but it belongs to exactly his
period, the end of the first century.</p>

<p>Hermas was a slave, or a freedman, in Rome. His work began
with a series of four visions, emphasizing repentance. The second
of these describes it as the business of Clement to send copies of
the visions to other churches, and this part of the book may go
<span class="pb" id="page_98"><b class="pb">{Page 98}</b></span>
back to the last years of his episcopate, which lasted from A.D. 88
to 97. If Hebrews created the situation he sought to correct, this
part must have been written between A.D. 95 and 97. It is significant
that Hermas expected his book to be circulated among the
churches.</p>

<p>Three or four years later, Hermas produced a larger work, the
<i>Shepherd</i> proper, in which the Shepherd appears and plays the
leading part, teaching Hermas and answering his questions. It
begins with a Revelation (“apocalypse”), which is followed by a
series of twelve Commands, telling how the repentant Christian
should live. They are followed by ten Parables, setting forth
the workings of repentance. As a Christian prophet Hermas feels
entirely free to lay down a new series of commands, without
any reference to the Ten Commandments of Judaism, and to
utter new parables, beside those of Jesus himself. But Hermas did
not know the fourfold gospel, and he shows few reflections of the
Old Testament.</p>

<p>In 1922 a third-century papyrus of the Shepherd (published in
1934 at Michigan by Campbell Bonner) came to light which when
complete evidently had precisely these contents, beginning with
the “revelation” which we know as Vision v, and containing the
twelve Commands and the ten Parables. The statement quoted
in Hippolytus (<i>Refutation</i> 9.13, English 9.8) from the Elkesaite
Alcibiades that a new repentance was proclaimed in the Roman
church in the third year of Trajan strongly suggests that this
second work of Hermas, the Shepherd proper, appeared A.D. 100.
It would naturally be described as proclaiming a new repentance.</p>

<p>Still later the two books were combined, the Visions preceding
the Shepherd, making the form preserved in part in the Codex
Sinaiticus, which contains about one fourth of the whole, and
the Athos manuscript (part of which is now at Leipzig), which
contains all but the last tenth. (The Michigan papyrus contains
<span class="pb" id="page_99"><b class="pb">{Page 99}</b></span>
almost one-fourth of the total text, but not the part missing from
the Athos manuscript.) This, which may be called the “complete
edition,” is also found in the two Latin versions, and in the
Ethiopic translation, published by d’Abbadie in 1860. A number
of smaller pieces, parchment or papyrus, also have been found,
some covering parts of what is missing from the principal Greek
manuscripts.</p>

<p>Hermas wrote in the simplest sort of vernacular Greek, now
familiar to us from the documentary papyri. He was naive, frank,
and informal in expression, and possessed of an originality and a
sincerity that gained him a wide hearing. His book was accepted
as part of the New Testament by Clement of Alexandria, toward
the end of the second century, and by Origen in the third, and
stood at the end of the New Testament in the Codex Sinaiticus,
about the middle of the fourth. Tertullian at first accepted it, but
later repudiated it. Irenaeus accepted it as scripture. Eusebius
put it among the rejected writings, but Athanasius in A.D. 367,
recommended it to new converts for private reading. It was
popular not only in Egypt and Abyssinia, but later through the
sect of the Manichaeans it was read as far east as Chinese
Turkestan. And in Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i>, A.D. 1300, Beatrice
and Vergil, his mediums of revelation, recall Rhoda and the
Shepherd, who performed the same service for Hermes.</p>

<h2>The Shepherd of Hermas</h2>

<h3>THE VISIONS</h3>

<h4>VISION I</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>The man who brought me up sold me to a woman named
Rhoda in Rome. Many years later I met her again, and I began to
love her like a sister. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Some time later, I saw her bathing in the
river Tiber, and I gave her my hand and helped her out of the
river. So when I saw her beauty I reflected in my mind and said,
“How happy I would be if I had a wife of such beauty and
disposition.” That was the only thought I had; I had no other.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>Some time later, as I was on my way to Cumae, glorifying God’s
creatures, they are so great and beautiful and strong, as I walked
along I fell asleep. And a spirit took me and carried me off
through a pathless region that a man could not make his way
through; it was precipitous and broken by the waters. So when
I had crossed that river, I came to level ground, and knelt down
and began to pray to the Lord and to confess my sins. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>As I was
praying, heaven opened and I saw this woman, whom I had
desired, greeting me from heaven and saying,</p>

<p>“Good morning, Hermas!”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>And I looked at her and said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, what are you doing here?”</p>

<p>She answered,</p>

<p>“I have been taken up here to expose your sins to the Lord.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>I said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, are you now the ground of my accusation?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_102"><b class="pb">{Page 102}</b></span></p>

<p>“No,” she said, “but listen to the words that I am going to say
to you. God who dwells in the heavens and created out of nothing
the things that are, and has increased and multiplied them for the
sake of his holy church, is angry with you, because you sinned
against me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>I answered her and said,</p>

<p>“Did I sin against you? Where or when did I ever utter a coarse
word to you? Have I not always regarded you as a goddess?
Have I not always respected you as a sister? Why do you falsely
charge me, my lady, with this wickedness and impurity?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>She laughed at me and said,</p>

<p>“The desire for evil occurred to your mind. Don’t you think
it is an evil thing for an upright man if an evil desire occurs to his
mind? It is a sin, and a great one,” said she, “for the upright
man has upright thoughts. So when his thoughts are upright, his
reputation is recognized in heaven, and he finds the Lord
favourable to him in everything he does. But those who think evil
thoughts in their minds bring death and captivity on themselves,
especially those who lay claim to this world and pride themselves
on their wealth, and do not cling to the blessings that are
to come. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Their souls will regret it; they have no hope, but they
have despaired of themselves and their life. But you must pray
to God, and he will heal your sins, and those of your whole household,
and of all the saints.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>After she had said these words, the heavens were closed, and
I was possessed with horror and grief. I said to myself,</p>

<p>“If this sin is to be recorded against me, how can I be saved?
Or how can I propitiate God for the sins I have committed? Or
with what words shall I ask the Lord to be gracious to me?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>While I was considering and debating this in my mind, I saw
before me a great white chair of snow-white wool and an aged
woman in shining clothing came up with a book in her hands,
and sat down by herself, and greeted me, saying,</p>

<p>“Good morning, Hermas!”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_103"><b class="pb">{Page 103}</b></span></p>

<p>And grieving and weeping I said,</p>

<p>“My lady, good morning.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>And she said to me,</p>

<p>“Why are you gloomy, Hermas? You who are so patient and
good-natured, and always laughing, why do you look so downcast
and far from cheerful?”</p>

<p>I said to her,</p>

<p>“Because of a very good woman, who says that I have sinned
against her.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>Then she said,</p>

<p>“Far be this thing from the slave of God! But at any rate a
thought about her did occur to your mind. Such a design involves
the slaves of God in sin. For it is an evil and shocking design for
a devout and already approved spirit, if it desires to do an evil
act, and especially for Hermas, the self-controlled, who refrains
from every evil desire and is full of perfect simplicity and great
innocence.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“Yet this is not why God is angry with you, but to lead you
to convert your family, which has sinned against the Lord and
against you who are their parents. But you are so fond of your
children that you have not corrected your family, but have
allowed it to become corrupt. That is why the Lord is angry
with you. But he will heal all your wrongdoings that have been
committed in your family, for because of their sins and iniquities
you have been corrupted by the matters of daily life. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But the
great mercy of the Lord has taken pity on you and your family,
and will make you strong and establish you in his glory. Only
do not be idle, but take courage and strengthen you family.
For just as the smith, hammering his work, masters the task that
he desires, so the daily upright teaching overcomes all wickedness.
So do not cease to correct your children, for I know that
if they repent with all their hearts they will be enrolled with the
saints in the books of life.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>After these words of hers had ceased, she said to me,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_104"><b class="pb">{Page 104}</b></span></p>

<p>“Do you want to hear me read?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” I said.</p>

<p>She said to me,</p>

<p>“Then listen, and hear the glories of God.”</p>

<p>I heard mighty and wonderful things, which I could not remember,
for all her words were awful, such as man cannot
endure. So it was her last words that I remembered, for they were
good for us and gentle.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Behold, the God of hosts, whom I love, who has by his mighty
power and his great understanding created the world, and by
his glorious design clothed his creation with beauty, and by his
potent word fixed the heavens and founded the earth upon the
waters, and by his own wisdom and foresight formed his holy
church, which he has blessed—behold, he is removing the
heavens and the mountains and the hills and the seas, and
all things will be level for his chosen, so that he may fulfil
to them the promise he made with great glory and joy, if they
keep with great faith the commands of God which they have
received.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>So when she stopped reading and rose from the chair, four
young men came and took the chair and went away toward the
east. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And she called me to her, and touched my breast and said
to me,</p>

<p>“Did my reading please you?”</p>

<p>And I said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, these last words please me, but the first ones were
hard and difficult.”</p>

<p>And she said to me,</p>

<p>“These last ones are for the upright, but the first are for the
heathen and the apostates.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>As she was talking with me, two men appeared and took her
by the arms and went away toward the east, where the chair was.
And she went away cheerfully, and said to me as she was going,</p>

<p>“Act like a man, Hermas!”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_105"><b class="pb">{Page 105}</b></span></p>

<h4>VISION II</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>When I was going to Cumae, at the same season as in the
previous year, as I was walking along, I recalled the vision of
the previous year, and again the spirit took me and carried me
off to the same place as the year before. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So when I reached the
place, I knelt down and began to pray to the Lord and to glorify
his name because he had thought me worthy and had made my
former sins known to me. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But after I had risen from prayer, I
saw before me the elderly woman whom I had seen the year
before, walking and reading aloud from a little scroll. And she
said to me,</p>

<p>“Can you report these things to God’s chosen?”</p>

<p>I said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, I cannot remember so much, but give me the little
scroll, so that I can copy it.”</p>

<p>“Take it,” she said, “and give it back to me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>I took it, and went away to a place in the country, and copied
it all letter by letter, for I could not make out the syllables. So
when I had finished the letters of the little scroll, the little scroll
was suddenly snatched from my hand, but by whom I could
not see.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>Fifteen days later, when I had fasted and earnestly asked the
Lord, the meaning of the writing was revealed to me. And this is
what was written:</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Your children, Hermas, have set God at naught and have
uttered blasphemy against the Lord, and through their great
wickedness have betrayed their parents, and have been called betrayers
of parents, yet they have not benefited by betraying them,
but they have further added wantonness and a mass of wickedness
to their sins, and so their iniquities have reached their
fullness. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But make these words known to all your children, and
to your wife, who is to be as your sister, for she does not control
her tongue, but does wrong with it. But when she hears these
<span class="pb" id="page_106"><b class="pb">{Page 106}</b></span>
words she will refrain, and she will find mercy. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>After you have
made known to them these words which the Master commanded
me should be revealed to you, then all the sins which they have
previously committed will be forgiven them, and all the saints
who have sinned unto this day, if they repent with all their
hearts and drive the doubts from their minds. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For the Master
has sworn by his glory, about his chosen, that if after this day
has been set there is any more sinning they will not find salvation.
Repentance for the upright comes to an end, the days of
repentance for all the saints are over, but for the heathen there
is still repentance until the last day. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So you must tell the
leaders of the church to rectify their ways in uprightness, so that
they may receive the promises in full, with great glory. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Stand
firm, therefore, you who do what is upright, and do not doubt,
in order that you may be admitted among the holy angels. Blessed
are you who endure the great persecution that is coming, and
who will not deny their life. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>For the Lord has sworn by his Son,
that those who have denied Christ have renounced their own
life, that is, those who are now going to deny him in the days
to come, but on those who denied him before, he has had mercy,
because of his compassion.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“But you, Hermas, must not hold a grudge against your children
any more, nor let your sister have her way, so that they may
be cleansed from their former sins. For they will be disciplined
with just discipline, if you do not hold a grudge against them.
Holding a grudge produces death. But you, Hermes, have had
great troubles of your own, because of the trangressions of your
family, because you paid no attention to them. Why, you
neglected them, and were absorbed in your wicked affairs. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But
you are saved by your not falling away from the living God
and your sincerity and your great self-control. These have saved
you, if you abide by them, and they save all who do such things,
and live in innocence and sincerity. These will prevail over all
evil and will endure to eternal life. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Blessed are all who practise
<span class="pb" id="page_107"><b class="pb">{Page 107}</b></span>
uprightness; they will never be destroyed. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But you must
tell Maximus, ‘Behold, persecution is coming; if it seems
best to you, deny again!’ The Lord is near those who turn to
him, as is written in Eldad and Modat, who prophesied to the
people in the desert.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Now a revelation was made to me, as I slept, brethren, by a
very good-looking young man, who said to me,</p>

<p>“Who do you think the elderly woman from whom you received
the little scroll was?”</p>

<p>“The Sibyl,” said I.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” he said, “it was not she.”</p>

<p>“Then who was it?” said I.</p>

<p>“The church,” said he. I said to him,</p>

<p>“Why, then, is she elderly?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “she was created first of all; that is why she
is elderly; and it was because of her that the world was formed.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>Afterward I saw a vision in my house. The elderly woman
came and asked me if I had given the scroll to the elders. I said I
had not done so.</p>

<p>“You have done right,” she said, “for I have some words to add.
So when I finish all the words, they will be made known through
you to all the chosen. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So you must write two little scrolls and
you must send one to Clement and one to Grapte. Then Clement
must send it to the cities abroad, for that is his function, and
Grapte will exhort the widows and orphans. But you shall read it
aloud to this city, with the elders who have charge of the
church.”</p>

<h4>VISION III</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>The third vision that I had, brethren, was this. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I had fasted
often and prayed the Lord to disclose to me the revelation he
had promised to show me through that elderly woman, and that
very night the elderly woman appeared to me and said to me,</p>

<p>“Since you are in such need and so eager to know everything,
<span class="pb" id="page_108"><b class="pb">{Page 108}</b></span>
go to the field where you raise spelt, and at eleven o’clock I will
appear to you, and show you what you must see.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I asked her,</p>

<p>“My lady, to what part of the field?”</p>

<p>“Wherever you please,” she said. I chose a beautiful, secluded
place; but before I told her and mentioned the place, she said
to me,</p>

<p>“I will come wherever you please.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>So I reached the field and counted the hours, and came to the
place where I had arranged with her to come, and I saw an
ivory couch placed there, and on the couch lay a linen cushion,
and on it was spread out a cloth covering of fine linen. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>When
I saw these things lying there, and no one at the place, I was
astonished, and a sort of trembling seized me, and my hair stood
on end, and a kind of shudder came over me, because I was
alone. So when I came to myself and remembered the glory
of God and took courage, I knelt down and confessed my sins
to the Lord again, as I had done before. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then she came, with
six young men, whom I had seen before, and she stood by me,
and listened while I prayed and confessed my sins to the Lord.
And she touched me and said,</p>

<p>“Hermas, stop saying all these prayers about your sins; pray
also for uprightness, so that you may take some part of it to
your family.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>Then she raised me up by the hand and led me to the couch,
and said to the young men,</p>

<p>“Go away and build.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>When the young men were gone and we were alone, she said
to me,</p>

<p>“Sit down here.” I said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, let the elders sit down first.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">9 </sup>“Do what I tell you,” she said, “sit down.” Then when I wanted
to sit at her right, she would not let me, but motioned to me with
her hand to sit at her left. As I was pondering and grieving because
she would not let me sit at her right, she said to me,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_109"><b class="pb">{Page 109}</b></span></p>

<p>“Are you grieved, Hermas? The place at my right belongs to
others, who have already pleased God and suffered for the
name. But you are far from ready to sit with them. But continue
as you do in your sincerity, and you will sit with them, and so
will all who do what they have done and bear what they have
borne.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“What,” said I, “did they bear?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said she. “Scourgings, prisons, great persecutions,
crosses, wild beasts, for the name. That is why the right side of
the sanctuary belongs to them, and to everyone who suffers for
the name. The left side belongs to the rest. But to both, those
who sit on the right and those who sit on the left, the same gifts
and the same promises belong; only, these sit on the right and
have a certain glory. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You earnestly desire to sit with them on the
right, but your defects are many. But you will be cleansed of your
defects, and all who do not doubt will be cleansed of all their
sins, up to this day.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>When she had said this she meant to go away, but I fell at
her feet, and entreated her by the Lord to show me the vision
that she had promised. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And she took me by the hand again and
raised me up, and made me sit on the couch, at the left, and she
sat down at the right. And she lifted up a shining staff and said
to me,</p>

<p>“Do you see something great?” I said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, I don’t see anything.” She said to me,</p>

<p>“Look! Do you not see right in front of you a great tower
being built on the waters, of glistening square stones?” <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And the
tower was being built in a square by the six young men who had
come with her, and tens of thousands of other men were bringing
stones, some from the deep and others from the land, and passing
them to the six young men, and they were taking them and
building. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>All the stones that were dragged out of the deep they
set in the building just as they were, for they had been shaped
and fitted the joints with the others, and they fitted one another
<span class="pb" id="page_110"><b class="pb">{Page 110}</b></span>
so closely that their joints did not show, and the tower building
looked as though it was built of a single stone. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Of the other
stones, which were being brought from the dry land, they threw
some away, and some they put into the building, and others
they broke up and threw far away from the tower. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Many other
stones were lying around the tower, and they did not use them
for the building, for some of them were scaly, and others were
cracked, and others were too short, and others were white and
rounded, and would not fit into the building. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And I saw other
stones being thrown far from the tower and reaching the road
and not staying on the road but rolling from the road into the
pathless ground, and others falling into fire and burning, and
others falling near the water and unable to roll into the water,
although some wished them to roll on and reach the water.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>When she had shown me these things, she wished to hurry
away. I said to her,</p>

<p>“My lady, what good does it do me to have seen these things
and not know what they mean?”</p>

<p>She answered and said to me,</p>

<p>“You’re an artful fellow, wanting to find out all about the
tower!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” said I, “so that I may report it to the brethren,
and they may be cheered, and when they hear this may come to
know the Lord in much glory.” <sup class="verse">2 </sup>She said,</p>

<p>“Many will hear, but when they hear, some of them will rejoice
and some will weep, but even these, if they listen and repent,
will rejoice too. So hear the parables of the tower, for I will
reveal everything to you. And don’t trouble me any more about
a revelation, for these revelations are at an end, for they have
been completed. But you will never stop asking for revelations,
for you are without shame.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“The tower that you see being built is myself, the church. I
have appeared to you now and previously. So ask whatever you
please about the tower, and I will reveal it to you, so that you
may rejoice with the saints.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>I said to her,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_111"><b class="pb">{Page 111}</b></span></p>

<p>“My lady, since you have once thought me worthy to reveal
everything to me, reveal it.”</p>

<p>She said to me,</p>

<p>“Whatever can possibly be revealed to you will be revealed.
Only let your heart be close to God, and do not doubt what you
see.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>I asked her,</p>

<p>“Why is the tower built on waters, my lady?”</p>

<p>“As I told you before,” said she, “you do question closely.
Well, if you question, you will find out the truth. Hear, then,
why the tower is built on waters: it is because your life has
been saved and will be saved by water. But the tower was
founded by the command of the almighty and glorious name, and
it is sustained by the invisible power of the Master.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>“My lady,” I answered, “this is a great and wonderful thing.
But who are the six young men who are building it, my lady?”</p>

<p>“These are the holy angels of God, who were first created, to
whom the Lord committed his whole creation, to increase it and
build it up and rule over the whole creation; so through them,
the building of the tower will be finished.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“And who are the others, who are bringing the stones?”</p>

<p>“They too are holy angels of God, but these six are superior
to them. So the building of the tower will be completed, and
they will all rejoice together around the tower, and will glorify
God because the building of the tower has been finished.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>I asked her,</p>

<p>“My lady, I would like to know what becomes of the stones,
and what they mean.”</p>

<p>She answered and said to me,</p>

<p>“Not because you are worthier than all others to have it revealed
to you, for there were others before you and better than
you, to whom these visions ought to have been revealed. But
in order that the name of God may be glorified, they have been
and will be revealed to you, because of the doubters, who debate
in their minds, whether these things are so or not. Tell them
<span class="pb" id="page_112"><b class="pb">{Page 112}</b></span>
that all these things are true, and none of them is beyond the
truth, but they are all potent, sure, and on a good foundation.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>“Now hear about the stones that go into the building. The
stones that are square and white and fit their joints are the
apostles and bishops and teachers and deacons who have lived
in the holiness of God, and have been bishops and teachers and
deacons for God’s chosen in purity and reverence. Some of them
have fallen asleep, and others are still living. They always agreed
with one another and were at peace with one another, and
listened to one another; that is why their joints fit together in
the building of the tower.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“But the ones that are dragged out of the deep, and put into
the building, and that agree in their joints with the other stones
already laid, who are they?”</p>

<p>“They are those who have suffered for the name of the Lord.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“But I want to know who the other stones are, that are brought
from the dry land, my lady.” She said,</p>

<p>“Those that go into the building without being shaped, the
Lord has approved, because they have lived in the uprightness
of the Lord, and carried out his commands.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“But who are the ones that are brought and set in the building?”</p>

<p>“They are young in the faith, and faithful, but they are exhorted
by the angels to do right, because wickedness has been
found in them.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“But who are the ones that they were rejecting and throwing
away?”</p>

<p>“They are the ones that have sinned and want to repent. That
is why they were not thrown far from the tower, because they
will be of use in the building if they repent. So those who are
going to repent will be strong in the faith, if they repent now,
while the tower is being built, but if the building is finished, they
will no longer have an opportunity, but will be outcasts. The
only thing they have is that they lie near the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_113"><b class="pb">{Page 113}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>“But do you want to know who they are that were broken
up and thrown far away from the tower? They are the sons of
disobedience; their faith was hypocritical, and no wickedness
escaped them. That is why they have no salvation, for on account
of their wickedness they are of no use in building. That is why
they were broken in pieces and thrown far away, because of the
Lord’s anger, for they angered him. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>As to the others that you
saw lying about in such numbers, and not going into the building,
the scaly ones are the ones that have learned the truth, but do
not stand by it.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“But who are the ones that were cracked?”</p>

<p>“They are those who are against one another in their hearts
and are not at peace with one another, but keep up an appearance
of peace, but when they leave one another, their wicked thoughts
remain in their hearts. These are the cracks that the stones have.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>But the ones that are too short are those who have believed
and live for the most part in uprightness, but they have some
fraction of disobedience; that is why they are too short and not
perfect.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“But the white and rounded ones, that would not fit into the
building, who are they, my lady?”</p>

<p>She answered, and said to me,</p>

<p>“How long are you going to be foolish and stupid, and ask
about everything and perceive nothing? They are those who have
faith, but have also the riches of this world. When persecution
comes, because of their riches and their business affairs they
deny their Lord.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>I answered her and said,</p>

<p>“My lady, when then will they be of use for the building?”</p>

<p>“When,” she said, “their riches, which lead their souls astray,
shall be cut off, then they will be useful to God. For just as the
round stone cannot be made square unless it is cut off and loses
some part of itself, so those also who have this world’s riches
cannot be of use to the Lord unless their riches are cut off. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Learn
first from your own case; when you were rich, you were useless,
<span class="pb" id="page_114"><b class="pb">{Page 114}</b></span>
but now you are useful and beneficial to life. Be useful to God,
for you yourself also benefit from the same stones.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>“As for the other stones that you saw thrown from the tower
and reaching the road and rolling from the road into the pathless
ground, they are those who have believed but because of their
doubt leave their true way. So thinking they can find a better
road, they go astray and trudge miserably over the pathless
ground. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And the ones that fall into the fire and are burned are
those who finally turn away from the living God and it no longer
occurs to their minds to repent, because of their wanton passions
and the wickedness they have done. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But do you want to know
who the others are who fall near the water and cannot roll into
the water? They are those who have heard the message and wish
to be baptized in the name of the Lord, then when the purity of
the truth comes to their remembrance, they change their minds
and follow their evil passions again.” <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So she concluded the
explanation of the tower.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>Still unabashed I asked her whether all these stones that had
been thrown away, and did not fit into the building of the tower,
could find repentance and have a place in this tower.</p>

<p>“They can find repentance,” she said, “but they cannot fit into
this tower. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But they will fit into another place far inferior, and
that only when they are tormented and fill out the days of their
sins. And this is why they will be removed from it, because they
have shared in the upright word. And then they will experience
removal from their torments, because of the evil deeds that they
have done. But if it does not occur to their minds, they will not
be saved, because of their hardheartedness.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>Then when I had stopped asking her about all these things,
she said to me,</p>

<p>“Would you like to see something else?”</p>

<p>As I was very eager to see more, I was delighted that I was
to do so. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>She looked at me with a smile and said to me,</p>

<p>“Do you see seven women around the tower?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_115"><b class="pb">{Page 115}</b></span></p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” said I.</p>

<p>“This tower is supported by them, by the Lord’s command.
Now listen to their activities. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The first of them, who is clasping
her hands, is called Faith; through her God’s chosen are saved.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>The next one, who is dressed for work and acts like a man, is
called Self-control; she is the daughter of Faith. Whoever follows
her will have a happy life, because he will refrain from all evildoing,
believing that if he refrains from every evil passion he
will make sure of eternal life.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“And who are the others, my lady?”</p>

<p>“They are daughters one of another, and they are named one
of them Sincerity, and the next Knowledge, and the next Innocence,
and the next Reverence, and the next Love. So when you
do all the deeds of their mother, you can attain life.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>“I would like to know, my lady,” said I, “what power each of
them possesses.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>“Listen,” she said, “to the powers that they possess. Their
powers are controlled by one another, and they follow one
another, in the order in which they were born. From Faith springs
Self-control, from Self-control, Sincerity, from Sincerity, Innocence,
from Innocence, Reverence, from Reverence, Knowledge,
from Knowledge, Love. So their deeds are pure, reverent, and
divine. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So whoever serves these, and has the strength to master
their deeds, will have his home in the tower, with the saints of
God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">9 </sup>Then I asked her about the times, whether it is already the
end. But she cried out loudly,</p>

<p>“Foolish man! Can’t you see that the tower is still being built?
When the building of the tower is finished, the end will come.
But it will be quickly built up. Don’t question me any more.
Let this reminder and renewing of your spirits suffice you and
the saints. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>But these things have been revealed not for you alone,
but in order that you may show them to all, <sup class="verse">11 </sup>after three days,
for you must first understand it yourself. And I command you,
<span class="pb" id="page_116"><b class="pb">{Page 116}</b></span>
Hermas, first to utter all these things that I am going to tell you,
in the hearing of the saints, so that they may hear and do them,
and may be cleansed from their wickedness, and you also with
them.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>“Listen to me, children. I brought you up in great sincerity
and innocence and reverence, by reason of the mercy of the
Lord, who instilled uprightness into you, so that you might be
made upright and be purified from all wickedness and all perversity.
But you are not willing to be made to cease from your
wickedness. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So now listen to me, and live at peace with one
another, and look after one another and help one another, and
do not partake profusely by yourselves of what God has created,
but share it also with those who are in want. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For some by eating
too much bring on bodily sickness and injure their bodies, while
the bodies of those who have nothing to eat are injured because
they do not have enough food, and their body is destroyed. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So
this lack of solidarity is harmful to you who have and do not
share with those who are in want. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Beware of the judgment to
come! So you who have more must seek out those who are going
hungry, while the tower is still unfinished, for after the tower
is finished, you will want to do good and will have no opportunity.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>So take care, you who pride yourselves on your wealth,
that those who are in want do not groan, and their groaning
go up to the Lord, and you with your goods be shut outside the
door of the tower. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So now I say to you leaders of the church
and to those who take the front seats, do not be like the magicians.
The magicians carry their potions in boxes, but you carry
your potion and poison in your hearts. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>You have become callous
and are not willing to cleanse your hearts and mix your wisdom
in a clean heart, so that you may obtain mercy from the Great
King. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So take care, children, that these divisions do not defraud
you of your life. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>How do you propose to train the Lord’s chosen,
if you have no training yourselves? So train one another and
live at peace with one another, so that I too may stand joyfully
<span class="pb" id="page_117"><b class="pb">{Page 117}</b></span>
before the Father and give an account for you all to the Lord.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>So when she stopped talking with me, the six young men who
were doing the building came and carried her away to the tower,
and four others picked up the couch and carried it also away
to the tower. Of these last I did not see the faces, because they
were turned away from me. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But as she was going away, I asked
her to reveal to me about the three forms in which she had appeared
to me. She answered and said to me,</p>

<p>“About these matters you must ask someone else for a revelation.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Now in the first vision last year, brethren, she appeared to
me as very aged, and sitting in a chair. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>In the second vision her
face was younger, but her skin and hair elderly, and she talked
to me standing up, and she was more cheerful than before. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But
in the third vision she was in all respects younger and exceedingly
beautiful; only her hair was that of an elderly woman, and she
was perfectly cheerful, and seated on a couch. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>I was deeply
grieved about this, wanting to learn this revelation, and in a
vision of the night I saw the elderly woman saying to me,</p>

<p>“Every asking of a question requires humility. So fast, and
you will receive what you ask from the Lord.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>So I fasted for one day, and that very night there appeared
to me a young man, and he said to me,</p>

<p>“Why are you so ready to pray for revelations? Take care, or
you will injure your body by so many requests. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>These revelations
are enough for you. Can you bear seeing mightier revelations
than you have seen?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">9 </sup>I answered him and said,</p>

<p>“Sir, this is all I ask, that there may be a full revelation about
the three forms of the elderly woman.”</p>

<p>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“How long will you be incapable of understanding? Why, it
is your doubts that make you unable to understand, and the
fact that you do not turn your heart to the Lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_118"><b class="pb">{Page 118}</b></span></p>

<p><sup class="verse">10 </sup>I answered him again and said,</p>

<p>“But from you, sir, we shall learn them more definitely.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>“Hear,” said he, “about the forms you ask about. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Why did she
appear to you in the first vision as elderly and sitting in a chair?
Because your spirits are aged and already withered, and have
no power, because of your infirmities and doubts. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For just as old
men, who have no longer any hope of renewing their youth,
have nothing to look forward to but falling asleep, so you also,
softened by the matters of this life, have given yourselves up to
apathy, and have not thrown your anxieties upon the Lord; but
your spirit has been broken, and you have been made old by
your sorrows.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, I should like to know, did she sit in a chair, sir?”</p>

<p>“Because anyone who is weak sits in a chair because of his
weakness, so that the weakness of his body may be supported.
This is the meaning of the first vision.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>“In the second vision, you saw her standing up, with a younger
and more cheerful face than before, but with the skin and hair of
an elderly woman. Listen,” said he, “to this parable also. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>When a
man grows old, and has already given up all hope of himself,
because of his weakness and poverty, and has nothing to look
forward to but the last day of his life, then suddenly an inheritance
is left to him, and when he hears of it, he gets up and is filled
with joy, and is clothed with strength, and he no longer lies
down but stands up, and his spirit which was previously broken
by his former misfortunes is renewed, and he no longer sits
down, but he acts like a man. It was so with you too when you
heard the revelation which the Lord made to you. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For he had
compassion on you and renewed your spirits and you put off your
weakness, and strength came to you, and you were made mighty
in faith, and the Lord rejoiced to see your access of strength,
and this is why he showed you the building of the tower and will
show you other things, if with all your hearts you live in peace
with one another.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_119"><b class="pb">{Page 119}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>“But in the third vision you saw her as younger and beautiful
and cheerful and beautiful in form. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For just as, if good news come
to someone in sorrow, he immediately forgets his former sorrows
and thinks of nothing but the news he has heard, and he is made
strong to do good in the future, and his spirit is renewed because
of the joy that he has experienced, so you also have experienced
the renewing of your spirits from seeing these blessings. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>As for
your seeing her sitting on a couch, it means that the position is
secure, for the couch has four feet and stands firm, for the world
too is sustained by four elements. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So those who have fully repented
will be young and firmly founded,—those who have repented
with all their hearts. Now you have the revelation in full. Do not
ask anything about a revelation again, but if there is any need, a
revelation will be made to you.”</p>

<h4>VISION IV</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>The fourth vision that I had, brethren, twenty days after the
preceding vision that had come to me, was a forecast of the persecution
that is at hand. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I was going into the country by the Campanian
Way; the place is about ten furlongs off the highroad, and
is easily reached. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So as I was walking along by myself, I prayed
the Lord to complete the revelations and visions that he had
shown me through his holy church, that he might strengthen me
and grant repentance to his slaves who had fallen away, so that
his great, glorious name might be glorified, because he had
thought me worthy to be shown his marvels. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And as I was glorifying
him and giving him thanks, what seemed a voice rang in
my ears in answer,</p>

<p>“Do not doubt, Hermas.”</p>

<p>I began to reason with myself and say,</p>

<p>“What reason have I to doubt, when I have been given such
a foundation by the Lord and have seen such glorious things?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>And I went a little nearer, brethren, and here I saw a cloud of
<span class="pb" id="page_120"><b class="pb">{Page 120}</b></span>
dust that seemed to reach to heaven, and I began to say to myself,</p>

<p>“Are there cattle coming and raising a cloud of dust?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>It was about two hundred yards away from me. As the cloud of
dust grew bigger and bigger, I suspected that it was something
from God. The sun shone out for a moment and here I saw a
huge beast something like a sea monster, and fiery locusts were
coming from its mouth. The beast was about a hundred feet long,
and it had a head like a wine jar. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And I began to cry, and to ask
the Lord to deliver me from it. And I recalled the words I had
heard, “Do not doubt, Hermes.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>So, brethren, I clothed myself in faith in the Lord, and remembered
the great things he had taught me, and took courage and
faced the beast. The beast was coming on with such a rush that
it could devastate a city. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>I went up to it, and the huge sea monster
stretched itself on the ground, and only thrust out its tongue, and
did not move at all until I had gone by. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>And the beast had four
colours on its head, black, then flame and blood colour, then
gold, then white.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>After I had passed the beast, and gone on about thirty feet,
behold, a girl met me, dressed as if she were coming from a bridal
chamber, all in white, with white sandals, veiled up to her forehead,
and on her head she wore a snood, but she had white hair.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>I knew from my earlier visions that she was the church, and I
was greatly cheered. She greeted me, saying,</p>

<p>“Good morning, my man.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, my lady,” I greeted her in return.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>She answered me and said,</p>

<p>“Didn’t anything meet you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” I said to her, “a huge beast did, that could
destroy whole peoples, but by the power of the Lord and his
great mercy I escaped from it.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“You deserved to escape,” said she, “because you cast your
care upon God, and opened your heart to the Lord, believing
that you cannot be saved by anything but his great and glorious
<span class="pb" id="page_121"><b class="pb">{Page 121}</b></span>
name. That is why the Lord sent his angel who has authority
over the beasts, whose name is Thegri, and he stopped its mouth,
so that it should not hurt you. Because of your faith you have
escaped great affliction, and because when you saw such a huge
beast you did not doubt. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Go, therefore, and tell the Lord’s chosen
his mighty deeds, and tell them that this beast is the symbol of
the great persecution that is coming. If therefore you will prepare
yourselves beforehand and will repent with all your hearts and
turn to the Lord, you will be able to escape it, if your hearts
become pure and blameless, and you serve the Lord blamelessly
the rest of the days of your lives. Cast your cares upon the Lord,
and he will remedy them. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Have faith in the Lord, you doubters,
for he can do all things, and can turn away his wrath from you,
and send forth plagues upon you doubters. Alas for those who
hear these words and disobey them; it would have been better
for them not to have been born.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>I asked her about the four colours that the beast had on its
head. She answered me and said,</p>

<p>“You are curious again about such things!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “my lady, tell me what they are.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Listen,” said she. “The black is this world, in which you live.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>The fiery bloody colour means that this world must be destroyed
in blood and fire. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>The gold part is you, who have fled from this
world. For just as gold is tested with fire, and made useful, so you
also who live in it are being tested. Then you who endure
and are tested by fire will be purified by it. Just as gold loses its
dross, you also will cast off all sorrow and tribulation, and be
purified and useful for the building of the tower. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But the white
part is the age to come, in which God’s chosen will live, for
those who have been chosen by God for eternal life will be
spotless and pure. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So do not cease to speak in the hearing of the
saints. Now you have the forecast of the great persecution that is
to come. But if you so will, it will be nothing. Remember what
is already written.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_122"><b class="pb">{Page 122}</b></span></p>

<p>With these words she went away, and I did not see where she
went, for a cloud appeared, and I turned back in fear, thinking
that the beast was coming.</p>

<h4>REVELATION V</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>After I had prayed at home, and had sat down upon my bed, a
man came in of splendid appearance, in the garb of a shepherd,
wearing a white goatskin, with a bag on his shoulders and a staff
in his hand. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>He greeted me, and I in turn greeted him. He sat
down at once beside me and said to me,</p>

<p>“I have been sent by the most reverend angel, to live with you
the rest of the days of your life.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>I thought he had come to tempt me, and I said to him,</p>

<p>“Well, who are you? For I know,” said I, “to whom I was
entrusted.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognize me?” he said to me.</p>

<p>“No,” said I.</p>

<p>“I am the shepherd, to whom you have been entrusted,”
said he.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>Even as he spoke, his appearance changed, and I recognized
him as the one to whom I had been entrusted, and I was bewildered,
and fear seized me, and I was completely overwhelmed
with sorrow that I had answered him so wickedly and foolishly.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>But he answered me and said,</p>

<p>“Do not be bewildered but find strength in my commands
which I am going to give you. For I am sent,” said he, “to show
you again all the things you saw before, the main points, which
are profitable for you. First of all, write down my commands
and my parables, but the other things you shall write as I
shall show them to you. That,” said he, “is why I command you to
write the commands and parables first, so that you may have
them at hand to read, and may be able to keep them.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>So I wrote down the commands and parables as he commanded
<span class="pb" id="page_123"><b class="pb">{Page 123}</b></span>
me. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>If, then, when you hear them you keep them and live by
them and carry them out with a pure heart, you will receive
from the Lord what he has promised you. But if when you hear
them you do not repent, but go on adding to your sins, you will
receive the opposite from the Lord. All these things the shepherd,
the angel of repentance, commanded me to write thus.</p>

<h3>THE COMMANDS</h3>

<h4>COMMAND I</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“First of all, believe that God is one, and he created all things,
and organized them and out of what did not exist made all things
to be, and contains all things, but alone is himself uncontained.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Trust him therefore and fear him, and fearing him, be self-controlled.
Keep this command, and you will cast away from yourself
all wickedness, put on every virtue of uprightness, and you
will live to God, if you keep this command.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND II</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>He said to me,</p>

<p>“Be sincere and simple-minded, and you will be like little children,
who do not know the wickedness that destroys the life of
men. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>First, speak evil of nobody, and do not enjoy hearing anyone
do so. Otherwise you who hear will be involved in the sin of the
one who speaks the evil, if you believe the evil that you hear
spoken, for by believing it you yourself also will be holding a
grudge against your brother. So you will be involved in the sin
<span class="pb" id="page_124"><b class="pb">{Page 124}</b></span>
of the one who speaks the evil. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Evil-speaking is wicked. It is a
restless demon, never at peace, but always at home with dissension.
Abstain from it, and you will always get on well with all
men. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Clothe yourself in reverence, in which there is no evil cause
for offence, but all is smooth and glad. Do right, and from your
labours which God gives you give generously to all who are in
need, not questioning to whom to give or to whom not to give.
Give to all, for God wishes that from what he gives gifts should
be made to all. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So those who receive will account to God as to
why they have accepted it and for what purpose. For those who
accept it because they are in distress will not be judged, but
those who accept it on false pretences will pay the penalty. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So
he who gives is innocent, for as he received from the Lord a
service to perform, he has sincerely performed it, without distinguishing
to whom to give or not to give. So this service,
sincerely performed, becomes glorious in the sight of God. So he
who renders it sincerely will live to God. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So keep this command,
as I have told you, so that your repentance and that of your
family may be found sincere, and your heart clean and stainless.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND III</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Again he said to me,</p>

<p>“Love truth, and let nothing but truth proceed from your
mouth, so that the spirit which God made to dwell in this flesh
may be found truthful in the sight of all men, and the Lord who
dwells in you will thus be glorified, for the Lord is truthful in
every word and with him there is no falsehood. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So those who lie
set the Lord at naught and become defrauders of the Lord, for
they do not return to him the deposit which they received. For
they received from him a spirit free from deceit. If they give this
back a lying one, they have defiled the Lord’s command and
become defrauders of him.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>So when I heard this I cried bitterly. And when he saw me
crying he said,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_125"><b class="pb">{Page 125}</b></span></p>

<p>“Why are you crying?”</p>

<p>“Because, sir,” said I, “I do not know whether I can be saved.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said he.</p>

<p>“Because, sir,” said I, “I have never in my life spoken a true
word, but have always talked deceptively with everybody, and
represented my lie as true to all men, and no one ever contradicted
me but they believed my word. How then, sir,” said I,
“after doing this, can I live?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Your thinking,” said he, “is right and true, for you ought
as God’s slave to have lived in truth, and a bad conscience ought
not to have dwelt with the spirit of truth, nor to have brought
grief to the revered, true spirit.”</p>

<p>“Never, sir,” said I, “have I correctly heard such words.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Well, now,” said he, “you hear them. Obey them, so that the
lies you have told heretofore in your business affairs may themselves
prove worthy of belief, now that what you now say has
been found true. For they also can prove trustworthy. If you
obey these words and henceforth tell nothing but the truth, you
will be able to attain life for yourself, and whoever will hear this
command, and abstain from the most wicked sin of lying, will
live to God.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND IV</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“I charge you,” said he, “to observe purity, and let no thought
occur to your mind about another man’s wife or about some
immorality or about any such like evil things, for if you do so,
you will commit a great sin. But if you always remember your
own wife, you will never commit sin. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if this idea occurs to
your mind, you will sin, and if other things as bad occur to you,
you commit sin. For this idea is a great sin for a slave of God,
but if any man commits this wicked act, he brings death upon
himself. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So beware; abstain from this idea, for where earnestness
dwells, there disobedience ought not to occur to an upright man’s
mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_126"><b class="pb">{Page 126}</b></span></p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, permit me to ask you a few questions.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” said he.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “if a man has a wife who believes in the Lord
and detects her in an adultery, does the husband sin if he continues
to live with her?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“So long as he is unaware of it,” said he, “he does not sin. But
if the husband knows of her sin, and the wife does not repent, but
persists in her immorality, and the husband continues to live with
her, he becomes involved in her sin and a sharer in her adultery.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>“What, then, sir,” said I, “is the husband to do, if the wife
persists in this attachment?”</p>

<p>“He must divorce her,” said he, “and the husband must live
by himself; but if after divorcing his wife, he marries someone
else, he too commits adultery.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>“If then, sir,” said I, “after the wife is divorced, she repents
and wishes to return to her own husband, will she not be taken
back?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>“Certainly,” said he, “if her husband does not take her back,
he sins, and involves himself in great sin. Why, the sinner who
repents must be taken back, but not often, for the slaves of
God can have but one repentance. So for the sake of her repentance,
the husband ought not to marry. This course of action is
incumbent on wife and husband. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Not only,” said he, “is it adultery
if a man defiles his flesh, but whoever imitates the actions of the
heathen commits adultery, so that if anyone persists in such
practices and does not repent, keep away from him and do not
live with him; otherwise you also share in his sin. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>That is why you
were commanded to live by yourselves, whether husband or wife,
for in such circumstances repentance is possible. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>I therefore,” said
he, “am not supplying an occasion for the matter’s ending in this
way, but that the one who has sinned may sin no more. As for
his former sin, there is one who can provide a cure, for it is he
who has power over all things.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_127"><b class="pb">{Page 127}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>I questioned him again, saying,</p>

<p>“Since the Lord has thought me worthy of having you live with
me always, permit me to say a few more words, since I have no
understanding and my heart has been hardened by my past deeds.
Make me understand, for I am very foolish and understand nothing
at all.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“I am in charge of repentance, and I give understanding to all
who repent. Or do you not think,” said he, “that this very
repentance is itself understanding? To repent,” he went on, “is
great understanding. For the man who has sinned understands
that he has done wrong in the sight of the Lord, and the thing
that he has done comes to his mind, and he repents and no
longer does wrong, but lavishes himself on doing good, and he
humbles his soul and torments it, because he sinned. So you
see that repentance is great understanding.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“This is why, sir,” said I, “I inquire into everything so particularly
of you; first, because I am a sinner, so that I may learn
what things to do in order to live, for my sins are many and
various.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“You will live,” said he, “if you keep my commands and observe
them. And whoever hears these commands and keeps them, will
live to God.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“Let me ask a further question, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>He said to me, “Go on.”</p>

<p>“I have heard, sir,” said I, “from some teachers, that there is no
other repentance than the one when we went down into the
water and received the forgiveness of our previous sins.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“You have heard correctly,” said he, “for that is so. For he who
has received forgiveness of sins ought never to sin again but
to live in purity. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But since you inquire into everything so particularly,
I will disclose this also to you, not as giving an excuse to
those who are going to believe, or to those who have already
believed in the Lord. For those who have already believed or are
<span class="pb" id="page_128"><b class="pb">{Page 128}</b></span>
going to believe have no repentance for sins, but have forgiveness
for their previous sins. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For those then who were called before
these days, the Lord prescribed repentance. For since the Lord
knows men’s hearts and knows everything beforehand, he knew
the weakness of human beings and the cunning of the devil,
that he would do some evil to the slaves of God, and act wickedly
to them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So the Lord, being merciful, had mercy on what he had
made, and set up this repentance, and authority over this repentance
was given to me. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But I tell you,” said he, “if after this great
and holy invitation a man is severely tempted by the devil and
sins, he has one opportunity to repent. But if he sins continually
and repents, repentance is unavailing for such a man; it will be
hard for him to live.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“I have been restored to life again, when I heard these things
from you so definitely, for I know that if I do not add any more
to my sins, I will be saved.”</p>

<p>“You will be saved,” said he, “and so will all who do these
things.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>I questioned him again, saying,</p>

<p>“Sir, since you have borne with me once, tell me this too
besides.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said he.</p>

<p>“If, sir,” said I, “a wife or again a husband falls asleep, and one
of them marries, does the one who marries sin?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“He does not sin,” said he, “but if he remains by himself he
wins greater honour for himself, and great glory with the Lord;
but even if he marries he does not sin. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So preserve purity and
gravity, and you will live to God. From now on, from the day
you were put in my charge, observe these things that I tell you
and am going to tell you, and I will live in your house. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Your
former sins will be forgiven, if you keep my commands, and all
men will be forgiven if they keep these commands of mine and
live in this purity.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_129"><b class="pb">{Page 129}</b></span></p>

<h4>COMMAND V</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“Be patient,” he said, “and understanding, and you will prevail
over all evil actions and do all uprightness. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if you are
patient, the holy Spirit that lives within you will be pure, not
being darkened by another, evil spirit, but living in a large room
it will rejoice and be glad with the body in which it lives, and
will serve God with great cheerfulness, for he is at peace
within. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But if any anger enters, the holy Spirit, which is sensitive,
is immediately distressed, for it does not find the place clean,
and seeks to leave the place, for it is choked by the evil spirit,
and has no room to serve the Lord as it desires, for it is contaminated
by anger. For the Lord dwells in patience, but the
devil in ill temper. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So if both spirits live together, it is unfortunate
and bad for the man in whom they live. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For if you take a
little wormwood and pour it into a jar of honey, is not all the
honey spoiled, and is not such a quantity of honey ruined by the
very little wormwood, and does it not destroy the sweetness of the
honey, and it no longer has the same favor with its owner, because
it has become bitter, and worthless? But if the wormwood is not
put into the honey, the honey is found sweet and is of use to its
owner. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>You see that patience is very sweet, more so than honey,
and useful to the Lord, and he lives in it. But ill temper is bitter
and useless. Then if ill temper is mixed with patience, patience is
contaminated, and its petition is no longer useful to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>“I would like to know, sir,” said I, “the operation of ill temper,
so that I may guard against it.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said he; “if you do not guard against it, you and
your family, you have lost all your hope. But guard against it, for
I am with you. And all those who repent with all their hearts
will keep themselves from it. For I will be with them and keep
them safe, for they have all been made upright by the most
revered angel.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_130"><b class="pb">{Page 130}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“Now listen,” said he, “to the operation of ill temper, how
wicked it is, and how it destroys my slaves by its operation, and
how it leads them astray from uprightness. But it does not lead
those astray who are filled with faith, nor can it operate upon
them, for my power is with them, but it leads the foolish and
doubters astray. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when it sees such men standing firm, it
inserts itself into that man’s heart, and for no reason at all, the
man or the woman is embittered about business affairs, or food,
or some trifle, or about some friend, or about giving or accepting,
or some such foolish matters, for all these things are foolish and
empty and meaningless and harmful to the slaves of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But patience
is great and strong, and possesses a power that is sturdy and
thrives in great enlargement, it is joyous, exultant, free from care,
glorifying the Lord at all times, with no bitterness in it, remaining
always meek and quiet. So this patience lives with those who
possess a faith that is perfect. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But ill temper is in the first place
foolish, fickle and senseless. Then from fickleness comes bitterness,
and from bitterness wrath, and from wrath anger, and from
anger vengefulness. And this being composed of such great evils
becomes a great and incurable sin. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For when all these spirits
reside in one vessel, where the holy Spirit also dwells, that vessel
cannot contain them, but overflows. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So the sensitive spirit, which
is not accustomed to live with an evil spirit, nor with harshness,
departs from such a man, and seeks to live with gentleness and
quiet. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Then when it leaves that man where it was living, that
man becomes void of the upright spirit, and being thereafter filled
with the evil spirits, he is unsettled in everything he does, being
dragged hither and thither by the evil spirits, and is utterly
blinded to good intentions. This, then, is what happens to all
who are ill tempered. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So abstain from ill temper, the most evil
spirit, and clothe yourself in patience, and resist ill temper and
bitterness, and you will find yourself with the holiness that is
loved by the Lord. Take care therefore never to disregard this
command, for if you master this command you will be able to
<span class="pb" id="page_131"><b class="pb">{Page 131}</b></span>
keep the rest of the commands that I am going to give you.
Be strong in them, and filled with power, and let all those who
want to live by them be filled with power.</p>

<h4>COMMAND VI</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“I commanded you,” said he, “in the first command, to observe
faith and fear and self-control.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“But now,” said he, “I want to show you their capabilities
also, so that you may understand what capability and effectiveness
each of them possesses. For their effects are twofold. So they
relate to right and wrong. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So trust what is right, do not trust
what is wrong. For uprightness has a straight way, but wrongdoing
a crooked one. But follow the straight and level way, and
leave the crooked one alone. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For the crooked way has no paths,
but broken ground and many obstacles, and it is rough and
thorny. So it injures those who follow it. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But those who follow
the straight way walk smoothly and without stumbling, for it is
neither rough nor thorny. So you see that it is better to follow
this way.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“I am pleased,” said I, “to follow this way.”</p>

<p>“You shall do so,” said he, “and whoever turns to the Lord
with his whole heart will follow it.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“Now hear about faith,” said he, “There are two angels with
man, one of uprightness and one of wickedness.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“How, then, sir,” said I, “am I to know their operations, for
both angels live with me?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Listen,” said he, “and you will understand them. The angel of
uprightness is sensitive and modest and gentle and quiet. So
when this one comes into your mind, he immediately talks with
you about uprightness, purity, reverence, self-control, and every
upright act and every glorious virtue. When all these things occur
to your mind, know that the angel of uprightness is with you.
<span class="pb" id="page_132"><b class="pb">{Page 132}</b></span>
So these are the things the angel of uprightness does. So believe
him and what he does. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Now observe what the angel of wickedness
does. First of all, he is ill tempered and bitter and foolish, and
his acts are wicked, destroying the slaves of God. So when he
comes into your mind, know him by what he does.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“I do not understand, sir,” said I, “how I am to recognize him.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “When ill temper comes over you, or bitterness,
know that he is in you; then the desire for much business,
and extravagance in many kinds of food and drink and many
drinking parties and various improper foods, and the desire for
women, and covetousness and a great arrogance and ostentation
and everything like them and akin to them—when these things
occur to your mind, know that the angel of wickedness is in you.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>So when you recognize his actions, get away from him, and do
not trust him, because his doings are wicked and harmful to the
slaves of God. Here you have the operations of both the angels.
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>Understand them, and trust the angel of uprightness. But get
away from the angel of wickedness, for his teaching is wicked
in all he does. For even if a man is a believer and the thought of
this angel occurs to his mind, that man or that woman is sure to
commit a sin. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>But again, even if a man or woman is very wicked,
and the doings of the angel of uprightness occur to his mind, he
must necessarily do something good. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So you see,” said he, “that
it is good to follow the angel of uprightness, and to bid the angel
of wickedness goodbye. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>This command tells what relates to faith,
in order that you may believe what the angel of uprightness does,
and through doing it may live to God. But believe that the
doings of the angel of wickedness are bad; so if you do not do
them, you will live to God.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND VII</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“Fear the Lord and keep his commands,” he said. “So if you keep
God’s commands, you will be strong in every action, and your
<span class="pb" id="page_133"><b class="pb">{Page 133}</b></span>
doing will be beyond criticism. For if you fear the Lord, you
will do everything well. This is the fear you must have to be
saved. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Do not fear the devil, for if you fear the Lord you will
master the devil, for there is no power in him. And where there
is no power, there is no fear either; but where there is glorious
power, there is fear too. For everyone who has power inspires
fear; but he who has no power is despised by everybody. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But
fear the doings of the devil, for they are evil. So if you fear the
Lord you will not do them, but refrain from them. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So there are
two kinds of fear; if you want to do wrong, fear the Lord and
you will not do it. But if again you want to do right, fear the
Lord and you will do it; so that the fear of the Lord is powerful,
great, and glorious. So fear the Lord, and you will live to him,
and all who fear him and keep his commands will live to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Why, sir,” said I, “did you say of those that keep his commands,
‘They will live to God’?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “all creation fears the Lord, but it does not
keep his commands. So life with God belongs to those who
fear him and keep his commands. But those who do not keep his
commands do not have life in him, either.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND VIII</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“I told you,” said he, “that God’s creatures are of a twofold
kind; for self-control too is twofold. For in some things we must
practise self-control and in some things we must not.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Inform me, sir,” said I, “in what things we must practise
self-control, and in what we must not.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “Be self-controlled about what is wrong, and
do not do it, but do not be self-controlled about what is right, but
do it. If you are Self-controlled about what is right, so that you
do not do it, you commit a great sin. But if you are self-controlled
about what is wrong, so that you do not do it, you practise great
uprightness. So restrain yourself from all evil, and do right.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_134"><b class="pb">{Page 134}</b></span></p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“What, sir,” said I, “are the kinds of wickedness from which we
must restrain ourselves?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “From adultery and immorality, from lawless
drunkenness, from wicked luxury, from many kinds of food, and
extravagance of wealth, and boastfulness and haughtiness and
pride, and from lying and evil speaking and hypocrisy, holding
grudges and all abusive language. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>These actions are the wickedest
of all in the life of men. So from these actions the slave of God
must restrain himself. For one who does not restrain himself from
these cannot live to God. So listen to the things that follow
them.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“But, sir,” said I, “are there still more wicked actions?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there are many,” said he, “from which the slave of God
must restrain himself—theft, lying, robbery, false witness, covetousness,
lust, deceit, vainglory, ostentation, and everything like
them. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Don’t you think these things are wicked?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very wicked,” said I, “for the slaves of God.”</p>

<p>“From all these things, the man who is serving God must
restrain himself. So restrain yourself from all these, so that you
may live to God, and be enrolled among those who practise
self-restraint in them. These, then, are the things from which you
must restrain yourself. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But listen to the things in which you must
not restrain yourself, but which you must do. Do not restrain yourself
in what is right, but do it.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>“Tell me, sir,” said I, “what you mean by right things, so that
I may live by them and serve them, so that by doing them I may
be saved.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, “to the deeds that are right, which you must
do, and not restrain yourself from. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>First of all, faith, fear of the
Lord, love, harmony, upright speech, truthfulness, endurance;
there is nothing in human life better than these. If a man observes
these, and does not restrain himself from them, he will be blessed
in his life. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>Then hear the things that follow them: waiting on
widows, looking after orphans and needy people, delivering the
<span class="pb" id="page_135"><b class="pb">{Page 135}</b></span>
slaves of God from distress, being hospitable (for doing good
may be found in hospitality), nonresistance to anyone, being
quiet, being more needy than all men, revering the aged,
practising uprightness, observing brotherhood, putting up with
insolence, being patient, not holding a grudge, encouraging the
weary in heart, not casting out those who have stumbled from
the faith, but converting and encouraging them, reproving
sinners, not oppressing debtors and those in need, and whatever
other actions are like these. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>Do you think these things are
right?” said he.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said I, “what can be better than these?”</p>

<p>“Then live by them,” said he, “and do not restrain yourself from
them, and you will live to God. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>So keep this command. If you do
right, and do not restrain yourself from it, you will live to God,
and all who do so will live to God. And again, if you do not do
wrong and restrain yourself from it, you will live to God. And
all who keep these commands and live by them will live to God.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND IX</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“Cast off doubt from yourself,” he said to me, “and do not
hesitate at all to ask God for anything, or say in yourself, ‘How
can I ask anything from the Lord and receive it, when I have
sinned so much against him?’ <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Do not reason thus, but turn to the
Lord with your whole heart, and ask of him undoubtingly, and
you will come to know his great mercy, that he will not desert
you, but will fulfill the request of your soul. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For God is not like
men, who hold grudges, but he is forgiving, and feels pity for
what he has made. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So cleanse your heart of all the vanities of this
world, and the things I have told you of, and ask the Lord, and
you will receive everything, and not fail to receive any of your
requests, if you ask the Lord without doubting. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But if you doubt
in your heart, you will receive none of your requests. For those
who doubt in their relation to God are the waverers and do not
get any of their requests at all. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But those who have perfect faith
<span class="pb" id="page_136"><b class="pb">{Page 136}</b></span>
ask for everything trusting in the Lord, and they receive it, for
they ask undoubtingly, without any wavering. For any man who
wavers, if he does not repent, can be saved only with difficulty.
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>So cleanse your heart of wavering, and clothe yourself in faith,
for it is strong, and trust God, that you will receive all that
you ask for, and if ever, when you have asked the Lord for
something, you are somewhat slow in receiving it, do not doubt,
because you did not receive your soul’s request quickly, for surely
it is on account of some temptation or some transgression of
which you are unaware, that you are slow in getting what you
asked for. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So do not stop making your soul’s request, and you
will receive it, but if you grow weary and waver, blame yourself
and not him who gives to you. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Beware of such wavering, for it is
wicked and foolish and uproots many from the faith, even men
who are very faithful and strong. For this doubt is the daughter
of the devil, and does the slaves of God great evil. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>So despise
wavering, and master it in every matter, clothing yourself in
strong and powerful faith, for faith promises all things, accomplishes
all things, but doubt distrusts itself and fails in everything
it undertakes. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>So you see,” said he, “that faith is from above, from
the Lord, and has great power, but doubt is an earthly spirit,
from the devil, and has none. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>So serve faith, which has power,
and keep away from doubt, which has none, and you will live to
God, and all who are so minded will live to God.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND X</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>“Put sadness from you,” said he, “for it is the sister of doubt
and bad temper.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“How, sir,” said I, “can she be their sister? For bad temper
seems to me to be one thing, and doubt another, and sadness
another.”</p>

<p>“You are foolish, man,” said he, “and do you not understand
that sadness is more wicked than all the spirits and most dangerous
<span class="pb" id="page_137"><b class="pb">{Page 137}</b></span>
to the slaves of God, and beyond all the spirits it destroys
the man, and wears out the holy Spirit, and again saves.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Sir,” said I, “I have no understanding, and cannot understand
these parables. For how it can wear out and save again, I cannot
see.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Listen,” said he. “Those who have never searched for the
truth nor inquired about the deity, but have merely believed, and
been involved in business and wealth and heathen friendships,
and many other affairs of this world—all who are absorbed in
these things cannot understand the parables of the deity, for they
are darkened by these doings and ruined and have become dried
up. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Just as fine vineyards, when they are neglected, are made
barren by the thorns and weeds, so men who have believed and
then get into these many activities that I have mentioned are
drawn aside from their purpose, and lose all understanding of
uprightness, but when they hear of deity and truth their mind is
absorbed in their business, and they understand nothing at all.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>But those who have the fear of God, and inquire about deity and
truth, and have their hearts turned toward the Lord, perceive
and understand what is said to them the more quickly, because
they have the fear of the Lord within themselves, for where the
Lord dwells, there is also great understanding. So hold fast to
the Lord, and you will understand and grasp everything.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“Hear then,” said he, “foolish man, how sadness wears out the
holy Spirit, and again saves. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>When the doubtful man undertakes
any enterprise and fails in it because of his doubt, this sadness
comes into the man, and offends the holy Spirit and wears it out.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>Then again when ill temper clings to a man about some matter,
and he is greatly embittered, sadness again comes into the ill-tempered
man’s heart, and he is grieved about the thing that he
has done, and repents because he has done wrong. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So this sadness
seems to bring salvation, because when he had done wrong
he repented. So both actions grieve the Spirit, doubt, because he
did not succeed in what he undertook, and ill temper grieves the
<span class="pb" id="page_138"><b class="pb">{Page 138}</b></span>
Spirit, because he did wrong. So both, doubt and ill temper,
distress the holy Spirit. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So cast sadness from you, and do not
distress the holy Spirit that dwells within you, that it may not
entreat God and depart from you. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For the Spirit of God which
has been put in our flesh will not endure sadness or restraint.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“So clothe yourself in cheerfulness, which always finds favour
with God, and is acceptable to him, and delight in it. For every
cheerful man does good things and thinks good thoughts and despises
sadness. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But the sorrowful man always does wrong. First,
he does wrong, because he grieves the holy Spirit which was
cheerful when it was given to the man; and, second, he does
wrong in grieving the holy Spirit, because he does not pray to the
Lord nor confess to him. For the petition of a man who is sad
never has power to ascend to the altar of God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Why,” said I, “cannot the petition of the man who is sad
ascend to the altar?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “sadness is entrenched in his heart. So the
sadness, mingling with the petition, prevents the petition from
ascending in purity to the altar. For just as vinegar and wine
mixed together do not have the same pleasant taste, so sadness
mixed with the holy Spirit does not have the same appeal. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So
cleanse yourself from this wicked sadness, and you will live to
God. And all who cast off sadness from themselves and clothe
themselves entirely in cheerfulness will live to God.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND XI</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>He showed me men sitting on a bench, and another man sitting
in a chair, and he said to me,</p>

<p>“Do you see those who are sitting on the bench?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“They are believers,” said he, “and the man who is sitting in
the chair is a false prophet, who is destroying the understanding
of the slaves of God. But he destroys that of the doubtful, not of
the believers. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>These doubtful ones, then, come to him as to a
<span class="pb" id="page_139"><b class="pb">{Page 139}</b></span>
soothsayer, and ask him what will happen to them. And this false
prophet, since he has no power of a divine spirit within himself,
talks with them about their questions and in accordance with
their wicked desires, and fills their souls, just as they wish. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For
since he is empty himself, he gives empty people empty answers,
for whatever he is asked, he answers according to the emptiness
of the man who asks it. But he says some things that are true,
for the devil fills him with his spirit, to see if he will be able to
break down one of the upright. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So all who are strong in the faith
of the Lord, being clothed with truth, do not join such spirits,
but keep away from them. But all who are doubtful and repent
often, practise soothsaying like the heathen, and bring upon
themselves greater sin by their idolatry. For the man who consults
a false prophet on any action is an idolater and void of the
truth and foolish. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For no spirit given by God needs to be consulted,
but having the power of deity, it says everything of itself,
because it is from above, from the power of the divine Spirit. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But
the spirit that is consulted and speaks according to men’s desires
is earthly and trifling, and has no power, and it does not speak
at all unless it is consulted.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>“How, then, sir,” said I, “is a man to know which of them is a
prophet, and which a false prophet?”</p>

<p>“Hear,” said he, “about both prophets, and in the way I am
going to tell you, you can test the prophet and the false prophet.
Test the man who has the divine spirit by his life. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>In the first
place, the man who has the spirit that is from above is gentle,
quiet and humble, and abstains from all wickedness and the
futile desire of this world, and makes himself more needy than
all men, and when he is consulted gives no answer to anyone,
and does not speak by himself nor does the holy Spirit speak
when a man wishes to speak, but speaks when God wishes him
to speak. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So when the man who has the divine spirit comes into
a meeting of upright men who have faith in the divine spirit, and
a petition is offered to God on the part of the company of these
men, then the angel of the prophetic spirit which is assigned to
<span class="pb" id="page_140"><b class="pb">{Page 140}</b></span>
him fills the man, and the man when he is filled with the holy
Spirit speaks to the congregation as the Lord wills. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>In this way,
then, the spirit of the deity will be made plain. Whatever power
therefore attaches to the spirit of deity belongs to the Lord. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>Hear
now,” said he, “about the earthly, futile spirit, which has no
power, but is foolish. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>In the first place, that man who thinks he
has the spirit exalts himself, and wants to have a front seat, and
he is immediately bold and shameless and talkative, and lives in
great luxury, and many other pleasures, and accepts pay for his
prophesying, and if he does not get it, he does not prophesy. Can
a divine spirit, then, accept pay for prophesying? It is impossible
for a prophet of God to do this, but the spirit of such prophets is
earthly. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>Then too, it does not come near a meeting of upright
men at all, but avoids them, and attaches itself to those who are
doubtful and vain, and prophesies to them in corners, and deceives
them, saying everything to them falsely, in line with their
desires, for it is answering empty-minded men. For an empty
vessel put among empty ones does not break, but they harmonize
with one another. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>But when he comes into a meeting full of upright
men who have the spirit of deity, and prayer is offered by
them, that man is emptied, and the earthly spirit flees from him
in fear, and that man is struck dumb, and is completely shattered,
unable to say anything. <sup class="verse">15 </sup>For if you store wine or oil in a storeroom
and put an empty jar among them, and again want to empty the
storeroom, you will find the jar that you put there empty, empty
still. So the empty prophets, when they come among the spirits of
upright men, are found to be just as they were when they came.
<sup class="verse">16 </sup>You now have the life of both kinds of prophets. So test the man
who says he is inspired, by his deeds and his life. <sup class="verse">17 </sup>But for your
part trust the spirit that comes from God and possesses power,
but do not trust the earthly and empty spirit at all, because there
is no power in it, for it comes from the devil. <sup class="verse">18 </sup>Listen, then, to the
parable that I am going to tell you. Take a stone and throw it up
to heaven; see if you can reach it. Or again, take a squirt of water
<span class="pb" id="page_141"><b class="pb">{Page 141}</b></span>
and squirt it toward heaven, see whether you can pierce heaven.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">19 </sup>“How, sir,” said I, “can these things be? For the things you
speak of are both impossible.”</p>

<p>“So,” said he, “just as these things are impossible, the earthly
spirits are impotent and weak. <sup class="verse">20 </sup>Now take the power that comes
from above. Hail is a very small grain, yet when it falls on a man’s
head, what pain it causes! Or again take a drop, which falls on
the ground from the roof and makes a hole in the stone. <sup class="verse">21 </sup>So you
see that the smallest things from above when they fall on the
earth have great power. So the divine spirit also comes from
above and is mighty. So trust that spirit, but keep away from the
other.”</p>

<h4>COMMAND XII</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>He said to me,</p>

<p>“Cast off from yourself every evil desire, and clothe yourself in
good and holy desire, for when you are clothed with this desire,
you will hate evil desire, and will control it as you please. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For
the evil desire is savage and hard to tame. For it is terrible, and
by its savagery it destroys men utterly, and especially if a slave of
God gets entangled in it, and has no understanding, he is terribly
destroyed by it, and it destroys such as have not the garment of
good desire, but are entangled with this world. These men, then,
it delivers to death.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“What kind of acts, sir,” said I, “are produced by the evil desire,
and deliver men to death? Tell me so that I may keep from them.”</p>

<p>“Hear,” said he, “by what kind of acts the evil desire puts the
slaves of God to death.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“Above all is the desire for someone else’s wife or husband, and
for the extravagance of wealth, and many needless things to eat
and drink, and many other foolish luxuries. For every luxury is
foolish and futile for the slaves of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>These, then, are the evil
desires and put the slaves of God to death. For this evil desire is
a daughter of the devil. So you must keep away from evil desires,
<span class="pb" id="page_142"><b class="pb">{Page 142}</b></span>
so that by doing so you may live to God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But as many as are
mastered by them, and do not withstand them, will finally die,
for these desires are deadly. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But clothe yourself in the desire for
uprightness, and arming yourself with the fear of the Lord, resist
them. For the fear of God dwells in the good desire. If the evil
desire sees you are armed with the fear of God, and resisting it,
it will flee far from you, and be seen by you no more, for fear of
your weapons. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So when you have conquered and triumphed over
it, come to the desire for uprightness and give up to it the victory
you have won, and serve it, just as it wishes. If you serve the good
desire, and are subject to it, you will be able to master the evil
desire and control it, as you please.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“I would like to know, sir,” said I, “in what ways I must serve
the good desire.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “Practise uprightness and virtue, truthfulness
and the fear of the Lord, faith and gentleness, and whatever
good things are like them. By doing these you will be an acceptable
slave of God, and will live to him, and everyone who serves
the good desire will live to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>So he finished the twelve commands, and he said to me,</p>

<p>“You have these commands; live by them, and exhort those
who hear you, that their repentance may be pure for the rest of
the days of their lives. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Perform carefully this service which I am
entrusting to you, and you will accomplish much, for you will
find favour among those who are going to repent, and they will
obey your words, for I will be with you and will compel them to
obey you.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Sir,” I said to him, “these commands are great and good and
glorious, and able to gladden the heart of the man who can keep
them. But I do not know whether these commands can be kept
by man, for they are very hard.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>He answered and said to me,</p>

<p>“If you set before yourself that they can be kept, you can easily
keep them, and they will not be hard. But if it once occurs to your
<span class="pb" id="page_143"><b class="pb">{Page 143}</b></span>
mind that they cannot be kept by man, you will not keep them.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>But now I say to you, if you do not keep them, but neglect them,
you will not have salvation, nor will your children nor your family,
since you have already decided for yourself that these commands
cannot be kept by man.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>He said these things to me very angrily, so that I was confounded,
and very much afraid of him, for his appearance
changed so that a man could not endure his anger. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But when he
saw that I was utterly confused and confounded, he began to
speak to me more kindly and cheerfully, and said,</p>

<p>“Foolish man, without understanding and doubtful, don’t you
understand how great, mighty and wonderful the glory of God is,
because he created the world for man’s sake, and made his whole
creation subject to man, and gave him complete authority to have
dominion over all things under heaven? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>If, then,” said he, “man is
master of all God’s creatures, and has dominion over them all, is
he not able to master these commands also? The man who has
the Lord in his heart,” said he, “is able to master all things and
all these commands. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But those who have the Lord on their lips,
while their hearts are hardened, and who are far from the Lord,
find these commands hard and difficult. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So you who are empty
and fickle in the faith put the Lord into your hearts, and you will
know that there is nothing easier, sweeter, or more gentle than
these commands. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Be converted, you who live under the commands
of the devil, which are hard and bitter and savage and
brutal, and do not fear the devil, because he has no power over
you. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For I will be with you, I, the angel of repentance, who can
control him. The devil causes only fear, but his fear has no force.
So do not fear him, and he will fly from you.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, listen to a few words from me.”</p>

<p>“Say what you please,” said he.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “man is eager to keep God’s commands, and there
is no one who does not pray to the Lord to be strengthened in
<span class="pb" id="page_144"><b class="pb">{Page 144}</b></span>
his commands and obey them, but the devil is hard and gets
control of them.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“He cannot,” said he, “get control of the slaves of God, who
hope in him with all their hearts. The devil can wrestle with
them, but he cannot throw them. So, if you resist him, he will be
beaten and fly from you in disgrace. But all who are not quite
full fear the devil as though he had power. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>When a man fills a
great many jars with good wine, and among the jars a few are not
quite full, he goes to the jars and pays no attention to the full
ones, for he knows that they are full, but he takes notice of the
ones that are not quite full, for he is afraid that they have turned
sour. For jars that are not quite full soon sour, and the flavor of
the wine is spoilt. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So the devil also comes to all the slaves of God
to tempt them. All, then, who are filled with faith stoutly resist
him, and he goes away from them, for he finds no place where he
can get in. So then he goes to those who are not quite full and
finding room he goes into them. and does what he pleases in
them, and they become his abject slaves.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>“But I, the angel of repentance, say to you, Do not be afraid
of the devil. For I have been sent,” said he, “to be with you who
repent with all your hearts, and to strengthen you in the faith.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>So put your trust in God, you who because of your sins have despaired
of your life, and added to your sins and weighed down
your life, for if you turn to the Lord, with your whole hearts and
do what is upright the rest of the days of your lives, and serve
him rightly in accordance with his will, he will provide a cure
for your former sins, and you will have power to master the
doings of the devil. Do not be at all afraid of the devil’s threats,
for he is as powerless as a dead man’s sinews. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So listen to me, and
fear him who can do all things, who can save and destroy, and
keep these commands, and you will live to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, now I am strengthened in all the requirements of the
Lord, because you are with me, and I know that you will break
<span class="pb" id="page_145"><b class="pb">{Page 145}</b></span>
in pieces all the power of the devil, and we will master him and
prevail over all his doings. And I hope, sir, that I can keep these
commands that you have commanded, if the Lord gives me
strength.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“You will keep them,” said he, “if your heart is pure toward the
Lord. And all who cleanse their hearts of the vain desires of this
world, will keep them, and will live to God.”</p>

<h3>THE PARABLES THAT HE TOLD ME</h3>

<h4>PARABLE I</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>He said to me,
“You know,” said he, “that you slaves of God live in a foreign
country, for your city is far from this city. So if,” said he, “you
know your city in which you are going to live, why do you prepare
lands and expensive establishments and buildings and useless
rooms here? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So the man who prepares these things for this
city cannot return to his own city. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Foolish, doubtful, wretched
man, don’t you understand that all these things belong to someone
else, and are in the power of someone else? For the lord of
this city will say, ‘I do not want you to live in my city, but get
out of this city, for you do not observe my laws.’ <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So if you have
lands and dwellings and many other possessions, what will you
do with your land and house and all the other things you have
prepared for yourself, when you are put out by him? For the lord
of this country can justly say to you, ‘Either observe my laws or
get out of my country.’ So what are you going to do, when you
have a law in your own city? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For the sake of your lands and your
<span class="pb" id="page_146"><b class="pb">{Page 146}</b></span>
other property, are you going to repudiate your law altogether
and live by the law of this city? Take care that it does not prove
disadvantageous to repudiate your law. For if you make up your
mind to return to your city, you will not be received, because
you have repudiated the law of your city, and you will be shut
out of it. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So take care; as one who is living in a foreign land, provide
for yourself no more than an adequate competence, and be
ready, so that when the master of this city wants to put you out
of it for disobeying his law, you can leave his city and go to your
city and joyfully observe your own law, uninjured. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So take care,
you who serve the Lord and have him in your hearts; do the
deeds of God, remembering his commands and the promises he
has made, and believe that he will fulfil them, if his commands
are kept. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So instead of lands buy distressed souls, as one is able,
and look after widows and orphans, and do not neglect them,
and spend your wealth and all your establishments on such
lands and houses as you have received from God. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>For this is why
the Master has made you rich, that you may perform these
services to him. It is far better to buy such lands and possessions
and houses as you will find in your city when you go home to it.
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>This extravagance is right and holy, and brings no sadness or
fear, but brings joy. So do not practise the extravagance of the
heathen, for it is bad for you who are the slaves of God. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>But
practise your own extravagance, in which you can rejoice, and
do not counterfeit or touch what belongs to someone else, or
desire it, for it is wicked to desire what belongs to someone else.
Do your own work and you will be saved.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE II</h4>

<p>Another parable.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>As I was walking in the country, and observing an elm tree
and a vine and contrasting them and their fruits, the shepherd
appeared to me, and said,</p>

<p>“What are you in search of, about the elm tree and the vine?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_147"><b class="pb">{Page 147}</b></span></p>

<p>“I am considering, sir,” said I, “that they are very well suited
to each other.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“These two trees,” said he, “constitute a figure for the slaves of
God.”</p>

<p>“I would like,” said I, “to understand the figure of these
trees, that you speak of.”</p>

<p>“Do you see the elm tree and the vine?” said he.</p>

<p>“I see them, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“This vine,” said he, “bears fruit, but the elm is an unfruitful
tree. But this vine unless it climbs up on the elm cannot bear
much fruit, because it is spread on the ground, and what fruit it
does bear is rotten, because it is not hanging on the elm. So when
the vine is supported by the elm, it bears fruit both from itself
and from the elm. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So you see that the elm bears much fruit, not
less than the vine, but rather more.”</p>

<p>“How, sir,” said I, “does it bear more?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “the vine when it hangs upon the elm bears
its fruit in abundance and in good condition, but when it is
spread on the ground, it bears very little fruit, and rotten at that.
So this parable applies to the slaves of God, to rich and poor.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Show me how, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “The rich man has money, but in his relations
to the Lord he is poor, for he is worried about his wealth, and
he offers very little prayer and confession to the Lord, and what
he offers is faint and small and has no other power. So when the
rich man rests upon the poor, and supplies his needs, he believes
that what he does to the poor man will be able to find its reward
with God, for the poor man is rich in prayer and confession, and
his prayer has great power with God. So the rich man unhesitatingly
provides the poor man with everything. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And the poor man,
being provided for by the rich man, prays to God and gives him
thanks for his benefactor, and he is still more zealous about the
poor man, that he may continue to live, for he knows that the
prayer of the poor is acceptable and rich in the Lord’s sight. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So
<span class="pb" id="page_148"><b class="pb">{Page 148}</b></span>
they both perform their work; the poor man works with prayer,
in which he is rich, which he has received from the Lord; he
gives it back to the Lord who supplies him with it. And the rich
man likewise unhesitatingly supplies the poor man with the
wealth which he has received from the Lord. And this is a deed
that is great and acceptable in the sight of God, because he understands
about his wealth and works for the poor man with the
gifts of the Lord, and properly performs his service. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>To men therefore
the elm tree does not seem to bear fruit, and they do not
know or perceive that when there is a drought, the elm, holding
water, sustains the vine, and the vine, having a constant supply
of water, bears double the amount of fruit, both for itself and for
the elm. So the poor also, praying to the Lord for the rich, fill
out their wealth, and the rich again, supplying the needs of the
poor, fill out their prayers. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So they are both partners in the upright
work. So the man who does these things will not be deserted
by God, but will be enrolled in the books of the living.
<sup class="verse">10 </sup>Blessed are those who have, and who understand that they are
made rich by the Lord, for the man who understands this will be
able to do some good service also.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE III</h4>

<p>Another parable.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>He showed me many trees which had no leaves, but seemed to
me to be dried up; for they were all alike. And he said to me,</p>

<p>“Do you see these trees?”</p>

<p>“I see, sir,” said I, “that they are alike and dried up.”</p>

<p>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“These trees that you see are the people who live in this world.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Why, then, sir,” said I, “do they seem to be withered, and
alike?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “neither the upright nor the sinners are
apparent in this world, but they are alike. For this world is winter
<span class="pb" id="page_149"><b class="pb">{Page 149}</b></span>
for the upright, and they are not apparent, for they live with the
sinners. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For just as in winter, the trees, having shed their leaves,
are alike, and do not show which are the dried-up ones and
which are alive, so in this world neither the upright nor the sinners
are apparent, but they are all alike.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE IV</h4>

<p>Another parable.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Again, he showed me many trees, some budding, and others
dried up, and said to me,</p>

<p>“Do you see these trees?” said he.</p>

<p>“I see them, sir,” said I, “some budding, and some dried up.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“These trees,” said he, “that are budding are the upright, who
are going to live in the world to come. For the world to come is
summer for the upright, but winter for the sinners. So when the
mercy of the Lord shines forth, those who serve the Lord will be
disclosed to all. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For just as the fruits of every single tree are disclosed
by summer, so also the fruits of the upright will be disclosed,
and they will all be known in that world because they are
flourishing. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But the heathen and the sinners, the dried-up trees
that you saw, such people will be found to be dried up and unfruitful
in that world, and they will be burned up like dry wood,
and they will be revealed, that their conduct in their lives was
wicked. For the sinners will be burned, because they sinned and
did not repent, and the heathen will be burned, because they did
not know him who created them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Bear fruit therefore in yourself,
so that in that summer your fruit may be known. Avoid much
business and you will make no mistake, for those who do much
business also commit much sin, being involved in their affairs,
and not serving their Lord. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>How, then,” said he, “can such a man
ask anything of the Lord and receive it, when he does not serve
the Lord? Those who serve him will receive what they ask
for. But those who do not serve the Lord will receive nothing.
<span class="pb" id="page_150"><b class="pb">{Page 150}</b></span>
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>But if a man works at a single business, he can serve the Lord
also, for his mind will not be corrupted and turned from the
Lord, but he will serve him with his mind pure. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So if you do this,
you can bear fruit for the world to come, and whoever will do
this will bear fruit.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE V</h4>

<p>Another parable.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>As I was fasting, seated on a certain mountain, and thanking
the Lord for all his dealings with me, I saw the shepherd sitting
beside me, and saying,</p>

<p>“Why have you come here so early?”</p>

<p>“Because, sir,” said I, “I am keeping a station.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“What,” said he, “is a station?”</p>

<p>“I am fasting, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“What is this fast,” said he, “that you are keeping?”</p>

<p>“I am fasting, sir,” said I, “just as I have been accustomed to do.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“You do not know how to fast to God,” said he, “and this useless
fast that you are keeping to him is not a fast.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say so, sir?” said I.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” said he, “that this which you think you are keeping
is not a fast, but I will teach you what a full and acceptable
fast to the Lord is.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said I, “you will make me happy if I learn the fast
that is acceptable to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Listen,” said he. “God does not want a futile fast like this, for
if you fast to God in this way, you will effect nothing for uprightness.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>But keep such a fast as this to God: Do no evil in your
life, but serve the Lord with a pure heart; keep his commands,
and live by his orders, and let no evil desire occur to your mind.
Believe God, that if you do this and fear him and restrain yourself
from every wicked act, you will live to God; and if you do
this, you will keep a great fast, and one that is acceptable to God.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_151"><b class="pb">{Page 151}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>“Listen to the parable I am going to tell you about fasting. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>A
man had a field and many slaves, and he planted a part of the
field as a vineyard. And as he was going on a journey, he selected
a slave who was most reliable, whom he liked and respected,
and called him in, and said to him, ‘Take this vineyard that I
have planted, and fence it, till I come, but do nothing else to the
vineyard. Carry out this command of mine, and you will be free
in my house.’ And the master of the slave went on his journey.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>And when he was gone, the slave took the vineyard and fenced it.
And when he had finished fencing the vineyard, he saw that the
vineyard was full of weeds. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So he thought it over to himself, and
said, ‘I have carried out that command of the owner; now I will
spade up the vineyard; it will look better after it is spaded up,
and having no weeds it will yield more fruit, because it will not
be choked by the weeds.’ He took the vineyard and spaded it up,
and pulled up all the weeds that were in the vineyard, and that
vineyard became very pleasing and thriving, for it had no weeds
to choke it. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>After a while, the master of the slave and the field
came, and went into the vineyard. And when he saw that the
vineyard was nicely enclosed and besides was spaded up, and all
the weeds were pulled up and the vines were flourishing, he was
greatly pleased with the work of his slave. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So he called in his
beloved son, who was his heir, and his friends, who were his advisers,
and told them what he had ordered his slave to do, and
what he had found done. And they congratulated the slave on
the testimony his master gave to him. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And he said to them, ‘I
promised this slave his freedom, if he kept the command I gave
him. But he has kept my command and has done good work on
the vineyard besides, and has pleased me greatly. So in return
for this work that he has done, I want to make him joint heir with
my son, because when he thought of a good thing, he did not
neglect it but carried it out.’ <sup class="verse">8 </sup>The master’s son agreed with this
decision, that the slave should be joint heir with the son. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>A few
days later, he gave a dinner, and sent him many dishes from the
<span class="pb" id="page_152"><b class="pb">{Page 152}</b></span>
dinner. When the slave got the dishes sent him by his master, he
took what was enough for him and distributed the rest to his
fellow slaves. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>His fellow slaves were glad to receive the dishes,
and began to pray for him, that he might find still greater favour
with his master, because he treated them in this way. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>His master
heard all this that had happened and was again greatly pleased
with his conduct. The master called all his friends and his son
together again and told them what the slave had done with the
dishes he had received, and they all the more heartily approved
the slave being made joint heir with his son.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“Sir,” said I, “I do not know these parables, and I cannot understand
them, unless you explain them to me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“I will explain everything to you,” said he, “and everything
that I shall talk with you about. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I will show you his commands;
and if you keep them, you will be pleasing to him, and be
enrolled in the number of those who keep his commands; and if
you do anything good beyond God’s command, you will gain
greater glory for yourself and be more honoured in the sight of
God than you would have been. So if while keeping God’s commands
you add these services also, you will be happy, if you
observe them as I command.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, I will observe whatever you command me, for I know that
you are with me.”</p>

<p>“I will be with you,” said he, “because you have the same zeal
to do right, and I will be with all,” said he, “who have this zeal.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>This fast,” said he, “of keeping the Lord’s commands is very good.
This, then, is the way you must keep this fast that you are going
to observe. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>First of all, guard against every evil word and every
evil desire, and cleanse your heart from all the vanities of this
world. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>If you observe these things, your fast will be perfect. And
this is what you must do: when you have completed what has
been written above, on the day on which you fast, you must taste
nothing but bread and water, and you must estimate the amount
<span class="pb" id="page_153"><b class="pb">{Page 153}</b></span>
of the cost for that day which you are going to observe of the
articles of food you would have eaten and give it to a widow or
an orphan or somebody who is in want, and so you will be humble
minded, so that as a result of your humility the man who
receives it may fill his soul and pray to the Lord for you. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So if
you carry out your fast in the way I command you, your sacrifice
will be acceptable in the sight of God, and this fast will be recorded,
and the service carried out in this way is right and joyous
and acceptable to the Lord. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>This is the way you must observe
these things, with your children and all your family, and if you
observe them you will be blessed, and all who hear them and
observe them will be blessed, and whatever they ask of the Lord
they will receive.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>I earnestly besought him to explain to me the parable of the
field and the owner and the vineyard and the slave who fenced
the vineyard in, and the palings, and the weeds that were pulled
up out of the vineyard, and the son and the friends who were the
advisers, for I understood that all these things were a parable.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“You are very insistent about asking questions. You ought not,”
said he, “to ask any questions at all, for if it is necessary to have
it explained to you, it will be explained.”</p>

<p>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, all that you show me and do not explain, there is no use
in my seeing, and not understanding what it means. In the same
way, if you tell me parables and do not interpret them for me,
there will be no use in my having heard you say something.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>He answered me again and said,</p>

<p>“Everyone,” said he, “who is a slave of God and has his Lord
in his heart, can ask him for understanding, and get it, and interpret
every parable, and the words of the Lord that are spoken
in parables will be made known to him. But all who are weakly
and sluggish in prayer hesitate to ask the Lord. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But the Lord is
very compassionate and never fails to give to all who ask him.
<span class="pb" id="page_154"><b class="pb">{Page 154}</b></span>
But when you have been strengthened by the glorious angel, and
had with him such conversation, and are not sluggish, why do
you not ask the Lord for understanding, and get it from him?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, when I have you with me, I must of necessity ask and
question you, for you show me everything and talk with me, but
if I had seen or heard them without you, I would have asked the
Lord to have it explained to me.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>“I told you just now,” said he, “that you were unprincipled and
persistent in asking for the explanations of the parables. But
since you are so determined, I will explain to you the parable of
the field and the rest of what followed, so that you can make
them known to everybody. Listen now,” said he, “and understand
them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The field is this world, and the owner of the field is
he who created all things and perfected them and gave them
power. The slave is the Son of God, and the vines are this people
which he himself planted. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The palings are the holy angels of the
Lord who hold his people together. The weeds which were
pulled up from the vineyard are iniquities of the slaves of God,
and the dishes that he sent to him from the dinner are the commands
which he gave his people through his Son, and the
friends and advisers are the holy angels who were created first,
and the master’s absence from home is the time that remains until
his coming.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, it is all great and wonderful, and it is all glorious. Could
I then,” said I, “have understood this? Nor can any other man
understand it, even if he is exceedingly intelligent. Further, sir,”
said I, “explain to me what I am going to ask you.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Speak,” said he, “if you want something.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said I, “is the Son of God put in the guise of a
slave, in the parable?”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>“Listen,” said he. “The Son of God is not given the guise of a
slave, but he is given great authority and dominion.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_155"><b class="pb">{Page 155}</b></span></p>

<p>“I do not understand how, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Because God planted the vineyard,” said he, “that is, created
the people, and he turned it over to his Son, and the Son appointed
the angels over them, to protect them, and he himself
cleansed their sins, after great labour and enduring much toil, for
no vineyard can be spaded up without toil or hardship. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So when
he had cleansed the sins of the people, he showed them the paths
of life, and gave them the law which he received from his Father.
You see,” said he, “that he is the Lord of the people, having received
all power from his Father. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But hear why the Lord took his
Son and the glorious angels as counsellors about the slave’s inheritance.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>The pre-existent holy Spirit, which created all creation,
God made to live in such flesh as he pleased. So this flesh, in
which the holy Spirit lived, served the Spirit well, living in holiness
and purity, and did not defile the Spirit at all. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So because it
had lived honourably and purely and toiled with the Spirit in
every act, conducting itself with strength and courage, he chose
it as a partner of the holy Spirit, for the conduct of this flesh
pleased him, because while possessing the holy Spirit it had not
been defiled on earth. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So he took the Son and the glorious angels
as counsellors, in order that this flesh also, after faultlessly serving
the Spirit, should have some place to live, and not appear to
have lost the recompense for its bondage. For all flesh in which
the holy Spirit has lived, which has been found undefiled and
unspotted, will receive a recompense. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Now you have the explanation
of this parable also.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>“I am glad, sir,” said I, “to hear this explanation.”</p>

<p>“Listen, now,” said he. “Keep this flesh of yours pure and undefiled,
so that the Spirit that lives in it may bear witness to it,
and your flesh may be made upright. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Take care that the idea does
not enter your mind that this flesh of yours is mortal, and you
misuse it with some defilement. If you defile your flesh, you defile
the holy Spirit also, and if you defile the flesh, you will not live.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“But if, sir,” said I, “there was a previous ignorance, before
<span class="pb" id="page_156"><b class="pb">{Page 156}</b></span>
these words were heard, how is the man who has defiled his flesh
to be saved?”</p>

<p>“For the earlier acts of ignorance,” said he, “it is possible for
God alone to give healing, for all power is his, <sup class="verse">4 </sup>but now keep it,
and the Lord who is all-merciful will heal them, if henceforth
you do not defile either your flesh or your spirit, for they are
both connected, and one cannot be defiled without the other. So
keep them both pure, and you will live to God.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE VI</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>As I was sitting in my house and glorifying the Lord for all
that I had seen, and questioning about the commands because
they were fine and possible and joyous and glorious and able to
save a man’s soul, I said to myself, How blessed I will be if I live
by these commands! <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Everyone who follows them will be
blessed. As I was saying this to myself, I suddenly saw him
sitting beside me, and saying,</p>

<p>“Why do you doubt about the commands that I have given
you? They are fine. Have no doubt, but put on faith in the Lord,
and you will follow them, for I will make you strong in them.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>These commands are beneficial for those who are going to
repent, for if they do not follow them their repentance is vain.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>So you who repent must lay aside the wickedness of this world
which leads you astray, and putting on every upright virtue you
will be able to keep these commands and not add any longer to
your sins. So if you add nothing to them, you will cut off much
of your former sins. So follow my commands and you will live
to God. All these things have been told you by me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>After saying these things to me, he said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us go out in the country, and I will show you the shepherds
of the sheep.”</p>

<p>“Let us go, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>And we came to a field, and he showed me a young shepherd
<span class="pb" id="page_157"><b class="pb">{Page 157}</b></span>
wearing a suit of clothes yellow in colour. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>He was feeding a great
many sheep, and these sheep seemed to be well fed and were
frisking vigorously and were joyously skipping hither and thither.
And the shepherd himself was joyful over his flock, and the very
appearance of the shepherd was very joyful as he ran about
among the sheep.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>And he said to me,</p>

<p>“Do you see this shepherd?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“This,” said he, “is the angel of luxury and pleasure. So he perverts
the souls of God’s slaves who are empty, and turns them
away from the truth, beguiling them with wicked desires by
which they are destroyed. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For they forget the commands of the
living God and follow pleasure and vain luxury and are destroyed
by this angel, some of them to death, and some to corruption.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, I do not know what ‘to death’ and ‘to corruption’ mean.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, “the sheep that you saw very joyfully skipping
about are those who have completely departed from God,
and have surrendered themselves to the desires of this world. So
for them there is no repentance leading to life, because they
have added to their sins and blasphemed against the name of
God. Their lot is death. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But the ones that you saw not skipping
about but feeding in one place are those who have surrendered
themselves to luxury and pleasure, but have not uttered any
blasphemy against the Lord. So these have been corrupted from
the truth. For them there is hope of repentance, by which they
can attain life. So corruption has some hope of renewal, but
death means eternal destruction.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>We went on a little further, and he pointed out to me a large
shepherd, who seemed savage in appearance, clad in a white
goatskin, with a bag on his shoulder, and carrying a very rough
and knotted staff and a great whip. And he had such a very
bitter look that I was afraid of him, he had such a look. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>This
<span class="pb" id="page_158"><b class="pb">{Page 158}</b></span>
shepherd was receiving from the young shepherd the sheep that
were frisking and well fed, but not skipping about, and he put
them in a precipitous place, full of thorns and briers so that
the sheep could not extricate themselves from the thorns and
briers, but were entangled in the thorns and briers. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So they were
feeding entangled in thorns and briers, and were very miserable,
being beaten by him, as he kept driving them about hither and
thither, and giving them no rest, and these sheep had no peace
at all.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>When I saw them so flogged and so wretched I was sorry for
them, because they were being so tormented, and had no relief at
all. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I said to the shepherd who was talking with me,</p>

<p>“Sir, who is this shepherd who is so heartless and severe, and
has no pity at all for these sheep?”</p>

<p>“That,” said he, “is the angel of punishment. He is one of the
upright angels, but is in charge of punishment. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So he takes charge
of those who wander away from God, and have followed the
desires and pleasures of this world, and punishes them as they
deserve, with various terrible punishments.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“I would like to know, sir,” said I, “what these different punishments
are.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, “to the different tortures and punishments.
The tortures are in this life, for some are punished with losses
and some with want, and some with various sicknesses, and some
with utter disturbance, and some with insults from worthless
people and with many other sufferings. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For many, being unsettled
in their purposes, attempt many things, and nothing at
all succeeds for them. And they say that they do not succeed in
their undertakings, and it does not occur to their minds that they
have done wrong, but they blame the Lord. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So when they are
afflicted with every affliction, they are turned over to me for
sound instruction, and they are strengthened in the faith of the
Lord, and serve the Lord with pure hearts the rest of the days of
their lives. So when they repent, it occurs to them that the things
<span class="pb" id="page_159"><b class="pb">{Page 159}</b></span>
that they have done were wrong, and then they glorify God,
and say that he is an upright judge, and that they suffered justly,
each for what he had done. And thenceforth they will serve the
Lord with pure hearts, and succeed in everything they do,
receiving from the Lord all that they ask. And then they glorify
the Lord, because they were turned over to me, and they never
again suffer any evil.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, explain this to me besides.”</p>

<p>“What more have you to ask?” said he.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “are those who live in luxury and pleasure tormented
for the same length of time as they spend in luxury and
pleasures?”</p>

<p>He said to me,</p>

<p>“They are tormented for the same length of time.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“They are tormented very little, sir,” said I. “For those who
live in luxury and forget God ought to be tormented seven times
as long.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>He said to me,</p>

<p>“You are foolish and do not understand the power of the
torment.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I did, sir,” said I, “I would not have asked you to
explain it to me.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, “to the power of both. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>The time of luxury
and pleasure is one hour, but an hour of torment has the power
of thirty days. So if a man indulges in luxury and pleasure for
one day, and is tormented for one day, the day of torment has
the force of a whole year. So a man is tormented as many years
as he lives days in luxury. So you see,” said he, “that the time
of luxury and pleasure is very short, but the time of punishment
and torment is long.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>“Since, sir,” said I, “I do not yet understand at all about the
time of pleasure and indulgence and of torment; explain it to me
more plainly.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_160"><b class="pb">{Page 160}</b></span></p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“Your foolishness is persistent, and you do not want to purify
your heart and serve God. Take care,” said he, “that the time does
not come and find you still foolish. So listen,” said he, “so that
you may understand it, as you want to do. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The man who lives
in indulgence and pleasure for one day, and does what he pleases,
has enveloped himself in great folly, and does not know what he
is doing. For he forgets on the morrow what he did the day
before. For indulgence and pleasure have no memories, because
of the folly which envelops them. But when punishment and
torment are fastened on a man, for a single day, he is punished
and tormented for a year, for punishment and torment have
long memories. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So when a man is tormented and punished for
a whole year, he remembers his indulgence and pleasure, and
knows that it is because of them that he is suffering these evils. So
every man that lives in indulgence and pleasure is tormented
thus, because though they had life, they have given themselves
up to death.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“What kinds of indulgence, sir,” said I, “are harmful?”</p>

<p>“Everything a man likes to do,” said he, “is indulgence for
him. For an ill-tempered man indulges himself when he yields
to his temper, and the adulterer and the drunkard and the
slanderer and the liar and the covetous man and the robber and
the man who does such things each yields to his disease. So he
indulges himself in what he does. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>All these indulgences are
harmful to the slaves of God. So because of these pleasures those
who are punished and tormented suffer. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>But there are indulgences
that save men, for many indulge in doing good, being
carried away by their own pleasure. So this indulgence is
advantageous to the slaves of God, and wins life for the man.
But the harmful indulgences already mentioned bring torments
and punishments upon them, and if they persist in them and do
not repent, they bring death on themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_161"><b class="pb">{Page 161}</b></span></p>

<h4>PARABLE VII</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>A few days later I saw him in the same field where I had seen
the shepherds, and he said to me,</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?”</p>

<p>“I am here, sir,” said I, “so that you may command the punishing
shepherd to leave my house, for he is distressing me too
much.”</p>

<p>“You have to be distressed,” said he, “for so the glorious angel
gave orders about you. For he wants you to be tested.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said I, “what have I done so bad that I should be
turned over to this angel?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Listen,” said he, “your sins are numerous, but not so great
that you should be turned over to this angel, but your family
has committed great sins and iniquities, and the glorious angel
has been incensed at their doings, and that is why he has given
orders that you should be distressed for a while, so that they too
may repent, and cleanse themselves from every desire of this
world. So when they repent and are purified, the angel of punishment
will leave you.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, even if they have done such things as to enrage the glorious
angel, what have I done?”</p>

<p>“They cannot be distressed in any other way than if you, who
are the head of the family, are distressed,” said he. “For if you
are distressed, they will necessarily be, but as long as you are
prosperous, they cannot experience any distress.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“But look, sir,” said I, “they have repented with all their
hearts.”</p>

<p>“I too know,” said he, “that they have repented with all their
hearts; then do you think that the sins of those who repent are
immediately forgiven? Not at all! But the man who repents must
torment his own soul, and be extremely humble in all that he does,
and be distressed with all kinds of afflictions. And if he bears the
<span class="pb" id="page_162"><b class="pb">{Page 162}</b></span>
afflictions that overtake him, the creator and sustainer of all
things will certainly take pity on him and give him some healing.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>This, of course, if he sees that the heart of the repentant man is
pure from any evil thing. But it is good for you and your family
to be distressed now. But why do I say so much to you? You
must be distressed, as that angel of the Lord who turned you
over to me has ordered. And thank the Lord for this, that he
has thought you worthy of being shown the distress beforehand,
so that knowing it is coming you may bear it bravely.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, be with me, and I will be able to bear any distress.”</p>

<p>“I will be with you,” said he, “and I will ask the punishing
angel to afflict you more lightly. But you will be distressed for a
little while, and you will be restored again to your place. Only
continue to be humble minded and to serve the Lord with a
pure heart, with your children and your family, and follow my
commands which I give you, and your repentance will be able
to be strong and pure. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And if you keep these commands with
your family, all distress will leave you, and distress will leave all
who follow these commands of mine.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE VIII</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>He showed me a great willow tree that overshadowed plains
and mountains, and all who were called by the name of the
Lord came under the shelter of the willow. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And an angel of the
Lord, glorious and very tall, stood beside the willow, with a
great sickle, and he was cutting branches from the willow, and
giving them to the people who were in the shade of the willow;
he gave them little sticks, about eighteen inches long. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>After
they had all got the sticks, the angel put down the sickle, and
the tree was as sound as when I had first seen it. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And I wondered
and said to myself, How can the tree be sound after so
many branches have been cut off? The shepherd said to me,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_163"><b class="pb">{Page 163}</b></span></p>

<p>“Do not wonder that the tree has remained sound after so many
branches have been cut off; see it all,” said he, “and it will be
made clear to you what it means.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>The angel who had given the sticks to the people asked them
back again, and in the order in which they had received them,
they were called to him and each one of them gave back the
sticks. And the angel of the Lord received them and examined
them. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>From some he received the sticks dry and apparently
worm-eaten. The angel ordered the ones who had given up such
sticks to stand by themselves. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And others gave them up dry,
but they were not worm-eaten. He ordered them also to stand by
themselves. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>And others gave them up half dry, and these stood
by themselves. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And others gave the sticks up half dry and cracked;
and these stood by themselves. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>And others gave their sticks up
green and cracked, and these stood by themselves. <sup class="verse">11 </sup>And others gave
their sticks up half dry and half green, and these stood by themselves.
<sup class="verse">12 </sup>And others brought their sticks up two-thirds of the
stick green and one-third dry, and these stood by themselves.
<sup class="verse">13 </sup>And others gave them up two-thirds dry and one-third green,
and these stood by themselves. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>And others gave up their sticks
all but a little green, but a very little of their sticks was dry,
at the very tip, and they had cracks in them; and these stood
by themselves. <sup class="verse">15 </sup>And of others there was very little green, and
the rest of each stick was dry, and these stood by themselves.
<sup class="verse">16 </sup>And others came bringing their sticks green, just as they had got
them from the angel; most of the people gave up such sticks, and
the angel rejoiced exceedingly over them, and they stood by
themselves. <sup class="verse">17 </sup>And others gave up their sticks green and budded,
and these stood by themselves; and the angel rejoiced exceedingly
over them. <sup class="verse">18 </sup>And others gave up their sticks green and
budded, and their buds seemed to have some fruit. And the men
whose sticks were found in this condition were very glad. And
the angel rejoiced over them, and the shepherd was very glad
about them.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_164"><b class="pb">{Page 164}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>And the angel of the Lord gave orders that crowns be
brought. And crowns were brought apparently made of palm
leaves, and he crowned the men who had given up the sticks
that had buds and some fruit, and he sent them off into the
tower. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And he sent to the tower the others also who had given
up their sticks green and budded but with no fruit on the buds,
and he gave them a seal. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And all those who went into the tower
had the same clothing, as white as snow. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And he sent those who
had given up the sticks green, just as they had received them,
and he gave them white clothes and a seal.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>After the angel had concluded this, he said to the shepherd,</p>

<p>“I am going away, but you must send these men inside the
walls, in so far as anyone deserves to live there. But examine
their sticks closely, and then send them on; but examine them
closely. See that no one slips by you,” said he, “but if anyone
does, I will test them at the altar.” After saying this to the shepherd,
he went away.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>And after the angel had gone away, the shepherd said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us take the sticks from all of them and plant them; perhaps
some of them will be able to revive.”</p>

<p>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, how can these dry things revive?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“This tree is a willow, and by nature tenacious of life. So if
the sticks are planted and given a little moisture, many of them
will live, and then I will try to pour water on them. If any of
them can live, I will rejoice with them, and if none revives, I
will not be found to have been negligent.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>The shepherd ordered me to call them, just as each of them
stood. They came up by groups, and gave up the sticks to the
shepherd, and he planted them in rows, and after planting them
he poured plenty of water on them, so that the sticks disappeared
in the water. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>And after he had watered the sticks he said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us go, and come back in a few days and look at all the
<span class="pb" id="page_165"><b class="pb">{Page 165}</b></span>
sticks, for the creator of this tree wishes all who have received
branches from this tree to live, and I too hope that these sticks
now that they have received moisture and been watered will
most of them live.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, tell me what this tree is, for I am perplexed about it,
because, though so many branches have been cut off, the tree is
sound and nothing at all appears to have been cut from it. So I
am perplexed about this.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Listen,” said he. “This great tree that overshadows plains
and mountains and all the earth is the law of God, which has
been given to all the world. And this law is the Son of God, who
has been preached to the ends of the earth. And the peoples
under the shade of it: are those who have heard the preaching
and believed it. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the great, glorious angel is Michael, who
has authority over this people and guides them, for it is he who
puts the law into the hearts of those who believe. So he observes
those to whom he has given the law, to see whether they
have kept it. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But you see the sticks of each one, for the sticks
are the law. So you see many of the sticks made useless, and you
will know that they are all men who have not kept the law;
and you will see each one’s dwelling.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, why did he send some off into the tower, and leave
others to you?”</p>

<p>“Those,” said he, “who had transgressed the law they had
received from him he has left under my authority, with a view
to repentance. But those who have satisfied the law and kept it,
he keeps under his own authority.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>“Who, then, sir,” said I, “are those who are crowned and go into
the tower?”</p>

<p>“The ones who are crowned,” he answered and said to me,
“are those who have grappled with the devil and conquered him.
They are the ones who have suffered for the law. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>The others
<span class="pb" id="page_166"><b class="pb">{Page 166}</b></span>
who themselves also gave up their sticks green and budded, but
with no fruit, are those who have been persecuted for the law
but did not suffer death, or deny their law. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>And those who gave
them up green just as they had received them, are holy and
upright and have lived with an exceedingly pure heart and
kept the Lord’s commands. The rest you will learn when I
examine these sticks that have been planted and watered.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>A few days later we went to the spot, and the shepherd sat
down in the great angel’s place and I stood beside him. And he
said to me,</p>

<p>“Fasten a towel about your waist and wait on me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>I put on a clean towel made of sackcloth. And when he saw
that I had put it on and was ready to wait on him, he said,</p>

<p>“Call the men whose sticks have been planted, in the order in
which each one gave up his stick.”</p>

<p>And I went back to the field and called them all, and they all
stood in rows. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>He said to them,</p>

<p>“Let each one pull up his own stick and bring it to me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>The first to give them up were those who had had them dry
and worm-eaten, and when they proved to be dry and worm-eaten,
he ordered them to stand by themselves. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Then those who
had them dry and not worm-eaten gave them up, and some of
them gave up their sticks green and some dry and apparently
worm-eaten. So those who had given them up green he ordered
to stand by themselves, and those who had given them back dry
and worm-eaten he ordered to stand with the first ones. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then
those who had had the half-dry and cracked ones gave them back,
and many of them gave them back green and free from cracks,
and some green and budded, and with fruit on the buds, such as
those who had gone into the tower crowned had had. And some
gave them up dry and worm-eaten, and some dry and not eaten,
and some were as before half dry and cracked. He ordered them
to stand each one by himself, some in their own rows and some
by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_167"><b class="pb">{Page 167}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Then those who had had their sticks green but cracked gave
them up. All these gave them up green, and took their stand in
their own row. And the shepherd rejoiced over them, because
they were all changed and had lost their cracks. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And those also
who had had them half green and half dry gave them back. So
the sticks of some were found entirely green, of some half dry, of
some dry and worm-eaten, and of some green and budded; all
these were sent off each to his appointed place. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Then those who
had had them two-thirds green and one-third dry gave them back.
Many of them gave them back green, and many half dry, and
others dry and worm-eaten. These all stood each in his appointed
place. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Then those who had had sticks two-thirds dry and one-third
green gave them up. And many of them gave them up half
dry, and some dry and worm-eaten, and others half dry and
cracked, but a very few green. All these took their stand in their
appointed place. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And those who had had their sticks green,
but a very little dry, and cracked, gave them up. Some of these
gave them up green, and some green and budded; these also
went to their appointed place. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then those who had had them a
very little green and the rest dry gave them up; their sticks
were found to be for the most part green and budded and with
fruit in the buds, and others were entirely green. The shepherd
rejoiced exceedingly over these sticks, because they were
found in this condition. And these went off each to his appointed
place.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>After the shepherd had examined the sticks of all of them, he
said to me,</p>

<p>“I told you that this tree was tenacious of life. Do you see,”
said he, “how many have repented and been saved?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir,” said I</p>

<p>“Observe,” said he, “that the Lord’s compassion is great and
glorious, and he has given the spirit to those who were worthy
of repentance.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Why, then, sir,” said I, “have not all repented?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_168"><b class="pb">{Page 168}</b></span></p>

<p>“He has granted repentance,” said he, “to those whose hearts
he saw would be clean, and who would serve him with all their
hearts. But to those whose guile and wickedness he saw, who
pretend to repent, he did not grant repentance, so that they
might not again profane his name.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Now, sir, explain to me what sort of person one of those who
have given up their sticks is, and where they live, in order that
those who have believed and have received the seal, and have
broken it, and have not kept it whole, when they hear it may
realize what they have done and repent, and receive a seal from
you, and glorify the Lord because he has had mercy on them,
and has sent you to renew their spirits.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Listen,” said he. “Those whose sticks were found dry and
worm-eaten are the apostates and traitors to the church, and men
who blasphemed the Lord through their sins, and besides have
been ashamed of the Lord’s name by which they were called. So
these have utterly perished to God. And you see that not one of
them has repented, although they have heard the words that you
have spoken to them, which I commanded you. From such men
life has departed. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And those also who gave up the sticks that
were dry and undecayed are close to them, for they were hypocrites
and brought in strange teachings, and led the slaves of
God astray and especially those who had sinned, not allowing
them to repent, but persuading them by their foolish teachings.
These, then, have a hope of repentance. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And you see that many
of them have repented since you told them my commands, and
more will repent. But those who will not repent have lost their
lives. But those of them that have repented have become good,
and have found their home inside the first walls, and some of
them have even gone up into the tower. So you see,” said he,
“that repentance for sins brings life, but failing to repent brings
death.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>“And those who gave them up half dry and with cracks in
them, hear about them too. Those of them whose sticks were half
<span class="pb" id="page_169"><b class="pb">{Page 169}</b></span>
dry are doubters, for they are neither alive nor dead. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And those
who had them half dry and with cracks in them are doubters and
slanderers and never at peace with one another, but are always
causing dissensions. But repentance,” said he, “is open to them
also. You see,” said he, “that some of them have repented
already. And for them,” said he, “there is still hope of repentance.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>And those of them,” said he, “who have repented will have their
homes in the tower, and those of them who have been slower
to repent will live inside the walls, and those who do not repent,
but persist in what they are doing, will surely die.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“And those who gave up their sticks green and cracked have
always been faithful and good, though they had some jealousy
of one another about pre-eminence and about some distinction.
But they are all foolish, to be jealous of one another about pre-eminence.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>But they also, when they heard my commands, purified
themselves and quickly repented, for they were good. So
they found their home in the tower. But if one of them turns back
to creating dissension, he will be cast out of the tower and
will lose his life. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Life belongs to all who keep the Lord’s commands,
but there is nothing in the commands about pre-eminence
or any distinction, but about a man’s patience and humility.
So the life of the Lord is in such men, but in creators of dissension
and transgressors there is death.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>“But those who gave up their sticks half green and half dry
are the ones who are absorbed in business and do not associate
with God’s people; that is why one-half of them is alive, and one-half
dead. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Many, then, when they heard my commands repented.
So the home of those who repented is in the tower. But some
of them deserted entirely. So they have no repentance. For on
account of their business they blasphemed the Lord and denied
him. So they have lost their lives because of the evil they have
done. And many of them doubted. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>These can still have repentance
if they repent quickly, and their home will be in the tower. And
if they repent slowly, they will live inside the walls. But if they
do not repent, they too have lost their lives. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And the ones who
<span class="pb" id="page_170"><b class="pb">{Page 170}</b></span>
gave them up two-thirds green and one-third dry are those who
have denied with many denials. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So many of them have repented
and gone into the tower to live, but many have fallen away
from God utterly; these have utterly lost their lives. And some of
them have doubted and created dissension. So repentance is still
open to them, if they repent quickly and do not persist in their
pleasures, but if they persist in what they are doing they also
bring death upon themselves.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>“And those who gave up their sticks two-thirds dry and one-third
green are the ones who have been faithful but have become
rich and honoured among the heathen; they have assumed great
haughtiness and grown arrogant and forsaken the truth, and have
not associated with the upright but have lived among the
heathen, and this way was pleasanter to them. But they did not
fall away from God, but remained in the faith, though they did
not do the things the faith does. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So many of them have repented
and found their home in the tower. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But others, living entirely
with the heathen and being corrupted by their vanities, have
fallen away from God and lived heathen lives. These have been
rated as heathen. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And others of them have doubted, and given
up the hope of being saved, on account of the things they had
done. And others have doubted and made divisions among themselves.
So for those who have doubted because of what they
had done there is still repentance, but they must repent quickly,
so that their home may be in the tower. But death is close to those
who do not repent but persist in their pleasures.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>“But those who gave up their sticks green, but with the very
tips dry and cracked, are the ones who have always been good
and faithful and glorious in the sight of God, but they have sinned
a very little because of small desires and grudges against one
another, but when they heard my words the greatest part of them
quickly repented, and they have found their home in the tower.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>But some of them have doubted and some of them in their doubt
have created greater dissension. So in their case there is hope
<span class="pb" id="page_171"><b class="pb">{Page 171}</b></span>
of repentance, because they have always been good; one of them
can hardly die. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And those who gave up their sticks dry, with a
very small part green, are the ones who have only believed, but
have done wicked things. But they have never fallen away from
God, and have gladly borne the name, and gladly welcomed the
slaves of God into their homes. So, hearing of this repentance,
they have unhesitatingly repented, and are doing all that is
virtuous and right. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But some of them are also afraid, for they
know the things that they have done. So all these will have their
home in the tower.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>After he had concluded the explanations of all the sticks,
he said to me,</p>

<p>“Go and tell all men to repent and live to God, for the Lord in
his compassion has sent me to give them all repentance, although
some do not deserve to be saved, because of what they have
done. But as he is long-suffering, the Lord wants those who
were called through his Son to be saved.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, I hope that all, when they hear them, will repent. For I
am convinced that each one when he realizes what he has done
and fears God will repent.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>He answered me and said,</p>

<p>“Those who repent with their whole hearts and cleanse themselves
from their wickednesses that have been mentioned, and
no longer add anything to their sins, will receive healing from the
Lord for their past sins, if they do not doubt about these commands,
and they will live to God. But those,” said he, “who
add to their sins, and follow the desires of this world, will condemn
themselves to death. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But you must follow my commands,
and you will live to God, and those who follow them and do
right will live to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>When he had showed me these things, and told me all this, he
said to me,</p>

<p>“The rest I will explain to you in a few days.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_172"><b class="pb">{Page 172}</b></span></p>

<h4>PARABLE IX</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>After I had written the commands and parables of the shepherd,
the angel of repentance, he came to me and said to me,</p>

<p>“I want to show you what the holy Spirit which talked with
you in the form of the church showed you; for that spirit is the
Son of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For since you were too weak in the flesh, it was not
shown you by an angel. So when you had been strengthened
through the spirit, and become strong in your strength, so that
you could even see an angel, then the building of the tower was
revealed to you through the church. You have seen it all well
and reverently, as revealed by a girl. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But now you see it by an
angel, through the same spirit. But you must learn it all more
exactly from me. For it was for this that I was assigned by
the glorious angel to come to live in your house, so that you
might see it all as well as possible, with none of the fear you
had before.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>And he led me off to Arcadia, to a rounded mountain, and
made me sit down on the top of the mountain, and he showed
me a great plain, and around the plain twelve mountains, each
with a different appearance.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>The first was black as soot, and the second was bare, without
any vegetation, and the third was full of thorns and briers. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>The
fourth had half-dry vegetation, green at the top but dry at the
roots, and some of the vegetation, when the sun had scorched it,
was turning dry. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>The fifth mountain had green vegetation and was
rough. The sixth mountain was entirely full of fissures, some
small and some large, and the fissures contained vegetation, but
the vegetation was not very flourishing but looked rather
withered. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>The seventh mountain had gay vegetation, and the
whole mountain was flourishing, and all kinds of cattle and
birds were feeding on this mountain, and the more the cattle
and the wild fowl ate, the more the vegetation of this mountain
flourished. The eighth mountain was full of springs, and every
<span class="pb" id="page_173"><b class="pb">{Page 173}</b></span>
kind of creature of the Lord was watered from the springs of
that mountain. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>The ninth mountain had no water at all and was
all desert, but it had wild animals on it and deadly reptiles that
destroyed men. The tenth mountain had huge trees and was all
shady, and under the shelter of the trees sheep lay resting and
chewing their cud. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>The eleventh mountain was thickly wooded,
and these trees were laden with fruit, adorned one with one fruit
and another with another, so that anyone who saw them wanted
to eat of their fruits. The twelfth mountain was all white, and
its appearance was gay, and the mountain itself was very
beautiful.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>In the middle of the plain he showed me a great white rock
that had risen from the plain. The rock was higher than the
mountains, square, so that it could hold the whole world. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And the
rock was old, and had a gateway carved out of it, but the carving-out
of the gateway seemed to me to be recent. The gateway
shone more brightly than the sun, so much so that I wondered
at the brightness of the gateway. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And around the gateway stood
twelve girls. The four who stood at the comers seemed to me
to be the most glorious, but the others were glorious too, and
they stood on the four sides of the gateway, two girls in the
middle of each side. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>They were dressed in linen garments and
were becomingly dressed for work, with their right shoulders
bare, as though about to carry some load. So they were ready,
for they were very gay and eager. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>On seeing this, I wondered
to myself, for I was seeing great and glorious things, and besides
I was at a loss about the girls, because though they were so
dainty, they stood manfully as though they were ready to carry
the whole heaven.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>And the shepherd said to me,</p>

<p>“Why do you reason with yourself and perplex and trouble
yourself? Do not attempt, as though you were intelligent, to
understand things you cannot understand, but ask the Lord that
you may receive intelligence and understand them. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>You cannot
<span class="pb" id="page_174"><b class="pb">{Page 174}</b></span>
see what is behind you, but what is before you can see. So let
what you cannot see alone, and do not distress yourself, but
master what you can see, and do not waste your strength on
the rest. I will explain to you everything that I show you. So
look at the rest.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>I saw that six men had come, tall and splendid, and looking
alike, and they called a multitude of men, and those who came
were also tall men, very handsome and strong. And the six men
ordered them to build a tower upon the rock. And there was a
great tumult of those men who had come to build the tower,
as they ran this way and that around the gateway. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And the girls
who were standing around the gateway told the men to hurry
to build the tower, and the girls held out their hands as though
they were going to receive something from the men. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the
six men ordered stones to come up from some deep place, and go
into the building of the tower. And ten gleaming square stones
came up, unhewn. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And the six men called the girls and ordered
them to pick up all the stones that were to go into the building
of the tower, and to pass through the gateway, and give them
to the men who were to build the tower. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And the girls put the
first ten stones that had come up from the deep place on one
another and together they carried them, one at a time.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>And just as they had stood together around the gateway, the
ones who seemed to be strongest picked it up and stooped under
the corners of the stone. And the others stooped at the sides of
the stone, and in this way they carried all the stones. And they
brought them through the gateway as they had been ordered to
do, and gave them to the men for the tower, and when they had
the stones they set to building. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The tower was built on the great
rock, and above the gateway. So those ten stones were fitted
together, and they covered the whole rock, and they formed the
foundation of the building of the tower, and the rock and the
gateway supported the whole tower. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And after the ten stones
twenty other stones came up from the deep place, and these
<span class="pb" id="page_175"><b class="pb">{Page 175}</b></span>
were fitted into the building of the tower, being brought by the
girls like the former stones. And after these thirty-five came up,
and these were fitted in like manner into the tower. And after
them forty other stones came up, and all these were put into the
building of the tower. So there were four courses in the foundations
of the tower. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And they stopped coming up from the deep
place, and the builders also stopped for a little while. And again
the six men ordered the multitude of the people to bring stones
from the mountains for the building of the tower. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So they were
brought from all the mountains, of different colours, quarried out
by the men, and they were given to the girls, and the girls carried
them through the gateway, and handed them over for the
building of the tower. And when the stones of various colours
were put into the building, they all alike became white and
changed their former colours. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>But some stones were handed
over by the men for the building and did not turn bright, but
were found just as they were put in. For they had not been
handed over by the girls, or brought in through the gateway. So
these stones were out of place in the building of the tower. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And
the six men, seeing the stones that were out of place in the
building, ordered them to be removed and taken down to their
place from which they had been brought. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>And they said to the
men that were bringing the stones,</p>

<p>“Do not put any stones at all into the building, but put them
by the tower, so that the girls may carry them through the gateway,
and hand them over for the building. For if,” said they,
“they are not brought through the gateway by the hands of
these girls, they cannot change their colours. So do not labour
in vain,” they said.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>And the building was ended on that day, but the tower was
not finished, for it was going to be built upon again. And there
was a delay in the building. And the six men ordered all the
builders to withdraw for a little while and rest, but they instructed
the girls not to go away from the tower. It seemed to me that
<span class="pb" id="page_176"><b class="pb">{Page 176}</b></span>
the girls were left to guard the tower. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But after all the men had
gone away and rested, I said to the shepherd.</p>

<p>“Why is it, sir, that the building of the tower has not been
finished?”</p>

<p>“The tower,” said he, “cannot be finished yet, unless its owner
comes and tests this building, so that if some stones are found to
be bad he can change them, for the tower is being built to meet
his wishes.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“I would like to know, sir,” said I, “what this building of the
tower means, and about the rock and the gateway and the mountains
and the girls and the stones that came up from the deep
place and were not shaped but went into the building just as they
were; <sup class="verse">4 </sup>and why first ten stones were laid for the foundation, then
twenty, then thirty-five, then forty, and about the stones that
went into the building and were taken out again and put back in
their place. Set my mind at rest about all these matters, sir, and
make them known to me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“If,” said he, “you do not prove idly curious, you will know
them all. For in a few days we will come here and you will see
the rest of the things that will happen to this tower and will understand
all the parables fully.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>A few days later we went to the place where we had sat, and
he said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us go to the tower, for the owner of the tower is coming
to examine it.”</p>

<p>So we went to the tower, and there was no one near it at all,
except the girls only. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And the shepherd asked the girls whether
the master of the tower had come, and they said that he was
going to come, to examine the building.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>And here a little later I saw a great body of men coming,
and in the midst of them was a man so tall that he was taller
than the tower. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And the six men who had charge of the
building walked with him at his right and at his left, and with
him were all who had worked on the building, and many other
<span class="pb" id="page_177"><b class="pb">{Page 177}</b></span>
glorious beings were about him. And the girls who watched the
tower ran up to him and kissed him, and began to walk beside
him around the tower. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>This man examined the building so
closely that he felt of each stone. And he had a stick in his hand,
and struck each stone that had been put into the building. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And
when he struck them, some of them turned as black as soot, and
some scaly, and some cracked, and some were too short, and
some neither black nor white, and some rough and not fitting the
other stones, and some badly spotted; these were the kinds of
defective stones that were found in the building. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So he ordered
all these to be removed from the tower and placed beside the
tower, and other stones brought and put in their places. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And
the builders asked him from which mountain he wanted the
stones brought and put in their places, and he did not order
them to be brought from the mountains, but he ordered them to
be brought from a plain that was near by. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And the plain was dug
up, and fine square stones were found, though some were round.
And all the stones that were anywhere in that plain were brought
and carried through the gateway by the girls. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>And the square
stones were shaped and put in the place of the ones that had been
taken out, but the round ones were not set in the building, because
they were hard to shape and slow to fashion, but they were
put by the tower, as though they were going to be shaped and
put into the building, for they were very fine.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>So when the glorious man, the owner of the whole tower, had
finished these things, he called the shepherd to him and turned
over to him all the stones that were lying beside the tower, which
had been removed from the building, and said to him,</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Clean these stones carefully, and put the ones that can fit the
rest into the structure of the tower, and throw the ones that do
not fit far from the tower.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>After giving the shepherd these orders, he left the tower, with
all those with whom he had come, but the girls stood around the
tower, guarding it. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>I said to the shepherd,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_178"><b class="pb">{Page 178}</b></span></p>

<p>“How can these stones go back into the structure of the tower
after being rejected?”</p>

<p>He answered me, saying,</p>

<p>“Do you see these stones?” said he.</p>

<p>“I do, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“The largest part of these stones,” said he, “I will shape and
put into the building, and they will fit with the rest of the stones.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup> “How, sir,” said I, “can they fill the same space after they
have been cut down?”</p>

<p>He answered and said to me,</p>

<p>“Those that are found too small will be thrown into the middle
of the structure, and those that are larger will be put on the
outside and will hold them together.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup> After telling me this, he said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us go, and after two days let us come and clean these
stones and put them into the building. For all around the tower
must be cleaned, so that the master may not come suddenly and
find things dirty about the tower and be incensed, and these
stones will not get into the structure of the tower, and I shall
seem to the master to be negligent.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>Two days later, we went to the tower, and he said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us examine all these stones and see which ones can go
into the building.”</p>

<p>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, let us examine them.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>And to begin with, we first examined the black stones, and they
proved to be just as they were when they were taken out of the
building. And the shepherd ordered them removed from the tower
and carried off. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Then he examined the scaly ones, and he took
many of them and shaped them and ordered the girls to take
them and put them into the building. And the girls took them
and put them into the building of the middle of the tower, and
the rest he ordered to be put with the black ones, for they also
were found to be black. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Then he examined the ones that were
<span class="pb" id="page_179"><b class="pb">{Page 179}</b></span>
cracked, and many of them he shaped and ordered to be taken
back by the girls into the building; and they were put on the outside,
because they were found to be stronger. But the rest could
not be shaped, because there were so many cracks. So for that
reason they were rejected from the building of the tower. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Then
he examined the short ones, and many of them proved to be
black, and some had developed great cracks, and he ordered
these also to be put with the ones that were thrown away. The
rest of them he cleaned and shaped and ordered to be put in the
building. And the girls took them and fitted them into the midst
of the structure of the tower, for they were so weak. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Then he examined
the ones that were half white and half black, and many
of them proved to be black, and he ordered them also to be taken
away with the ones that were rejected. But all the rest were
taken by the girls, for as they were white, they were fitted by the
girls themselves into the building, and they were put on the outside
for they were found to be sound, so that they could hold the
ones that were put in the middle, for not one of them was too
short. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then he examined the rough, hard ones, and a few of them
were rejected, because they could not be shaped, for they proved
to be too hard. But the rest of them were shaped, and taken by the
girls, and fitted into the middle of the structure of the tower, for
they were too weak. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Then he examined the ones that had spots,
and a very few of them had turned black and were rejected and
put with the rest, but the remainder proved to be bright and
sound, and these were fitted into the building by the girls, and
were put on the outside because of their strength.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>Then he went to examine the round, white stones, and he
said to me,</p>

<p>“What are we to do about these stones?”</p>

<p>“How do I know, sir?” said I.</p>

<p>“Then do you notice nothing about them?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“I do not possess this craft, sir,” said I, “I am not a mason, nor
do I understand it.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_180"><b class="pb">{Page 180}</b></span></p>

<p>“Do you not see,” said he, “that they are very round, and if I
want to make them square, a great deal must be cut off from
them? But some of them must necessarily be put into the
building.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“If, then, sir, it is necessary,” said I, “why do you torment
yourself, and not select the ones you want for the building, and
fit them into it?”</p>

<p>He selected from them the largest, bright ones, and shaped
them, and the girls took them and fitted them into the outside
of the building. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And the rest that were left over were taken and
put back in the plain from which they had been brought. But
they were not rejected,</p>

<p>“For,” said he, “there is still left a little of the tower to be built
and the master of the tower wants all these stones fitted into the
building, because they are very bright.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>And twelve women were called, very beautiful in form, clad
in black, dressed for work, with their shoulders bare and their
hair down, and these women seemed to me to be savage. And
the shepherd ordered them to pick up the stones that had been
rejected from the building and take them back to the mountains
from which they had been brought. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And they picked them up
gladly and took all the stones back and put them where they
had been taken from. And after all the stones had been taken
away, and not a stone lay around the tower any longer, the
shepherd said to me,</p>

<p>“Let us go around the tower and see whether there is any
imperfection in it.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>And I went around it with him. And when the shepherd saw
that the tower was beautifully built, he was very glad, for the
tower was so built that when I saw it I coveted its building, for
it was built as though it was made of one stone, without a single
joint in it. The stone appeared to have been cut out of the rock,
for it seemed to me to be all one stone.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>And as I went with him I was glad to see such good things.
And the shepherd said to me,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_181"><b class="pb">{Page 181}</b></span></p>

<p>“Go and get some unslaked lime and a thin potsherd, so that
I can fill up the prints of the stones that have been taken up
and put into the building, for it must be smooth all around the
tower.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>And I did as he ordered, and brought them to him.</p>

<p>“Wait on me,” said he, “and the work will soon be finished.”</p>

<p>So he filled up the prints of the stones that had gone into the
building, and ordered all around the tower to be swept and
cleaned. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the girls took brooms and swept and removed all
the dirt from the tower, and sprinkled water about, and the
location of the tower became gay and very attractive. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>The
shepherd said to me,</p>

<p>“It has all been cleaned,” said he. “If the owner comes to look
the tower over, he will have nothing to blame us for.”</p>

<p>With these words he was going to go away. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But I took hold of
his wallet and began to adjure him by the Lord to explain to me
what he had shown me. He said to me,</p>

<p>“I am busy for a while, and then I will explain it all to you.
Wait here for me until I come.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, what am I to do here alone?”</p>

<p>“You are not alone,” said he, “for these girls are with you.”</p>

<p>“Then commend me to them,” said I.</p>

<p>The shepherd called them to him and said to them,</p>

<p>“I entrust this man to you until I come.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">7 </sup>And he went away. And I was alone with the girls and they
were very gay and were kind to me, especially the four of them
that were the most glorious.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>The girls said to me,</p>

<p>“The shepherd is not coming here today.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do then?” said I.</p>

<p>“Wait for him until evening,” they said, “and if he comes he
will talk with you, but if he does not come, you must stay here
with us until he comes.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>I said to them,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_182"><b class="pb">{Page 182}</b></span></p>

<p>“I will wait for him until evening, and if he does not come,
I will go back to my house, and come back in the morning.”</p>

<p>But they answered and said to me,</p>

<p>“You were entrusted to us; you cannot leave us.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Where, then,” said I, “am I to stay?”</p>

<p>“You shall sleep with us,” they said, “as a brother, not a
husband, for you are our brother, and in future we are going to
live with you, for we love you dearly.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>But I was ashamed to stay with them. And the one who
seemed to be the foremost of them began to kiss me and embrace
me. And the others seeing her embracing me began to kiss me
themselves, and to take me around the tower and play with me. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>I
too seemed to have become young again, and began to play
with them myself, for some were doing choral dancing, and
others were dancing, and others were singing, and I walked
around the tower with them in silence, and was happy with
them. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>When evening came, I wanted to go home, but they
would not let me go but detained me, and I stayed with them
that night, and slept beside the tower. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For the girls spread their
linen garments on the ground and made me lie down in the midst
of them, and they did nothing at all but pray, and I too prayed
unceasingly with them, and the girls rejoiced when I prayed
thus and I stayed there with the girls until eight o’clock the next
morning.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>Then the shepherd came, and he said to the girls,</p>

<p>“Have you done him any harm?”</p>

<p>“Ask him,” they said.</p>

<p>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, I enjoyed staying with them.”</p>

<p>“What did you have for supper?” said he.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “I had the words of the Lord for supper all night
long.”</p>

<p>“Did they treat you well?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">9 </sup>“Now,” said he, “what do you want to hear first?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_183"><b class="pb">{Page 183}</b></span></p>

<p>“Just as you showed me from the beginning, sir,” said I, “I ask
you, sir, to explain them to me just as I ask you.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please,” said he, “I will explain them to you, and
I will conceal nothing at all from you.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>“First of all, sir,” said I, “show me this: the rock and the gateway—who
is it?”</p>

<p>“This rock and gateway,” said he, “are the son of God.”</p>

<p>“How is it, sir,” said I, “that the rock is old, but the gateway
is new?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Listen,” said he, “and understand, foolish man. The Son of
God is far older than all his creation, so that he was the Father’s
counsellor in his creation. That is why the rock is old.”</p>

<p>“But why is the gateway new, sir?” said I.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Because,” said he, “he was revealed in the last days of the
consummation; that is why the gateway is new, so that those
who are going to be saved may enter the kingdom of God
through it. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Did you see,” said he, “that the stones that came in
through the gateway were put into the building of the tower,
but the ones that had not come in were put back in the place
they came from?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” said I,</p>

<p>“So,” said he, “no one will enter the kingdom of God unless
he takes his holy name. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For if you want to enter a city, and
that city is walled around, and has a single gateway, can you
enter that city except by the gateway that it has?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said I, “how can it be done in any other way?”</p>

<p>“Then if you cannot enter the city except by the gateway
that it has, so,” said he, “a man cannot enter the kingdom of
God in any other way than through the name of his Son, who
was beloved by him.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>“Did you see,” said he, “the crowd that was building the
tower?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“They are all glorious angels,” said he, “so by them the Lord
<span class="pb" id="page_184"><b class="pb">{Page 184}</b></span>
is walled about. But the gateway is the Son of God; this is the
only entrance to the Lord. So no one can go in to him in any other
way than through his Son. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Did you see,” said he, “the six
men, and in the midst of them the tall, splendid man who was
walking about the tower and rejected the stones from the
building?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>“The splendid man,” said he, “is the Son of God, and the six
are the glorious angels attending him on his right and left. None
of these glorious angels,” said he, “can enter God’s presence
without him. Whoever does not take his name cannot enter the
kingdom of God.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>“But who is the tower?” said I.</p>

<p>“This tower,” said he, “is the church.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“And who are these girls?”</p>

<p>“These,” said he, “are holy spirits, and a man cannot find his
way into the kingdom of God in any other way than by being
clothed by them with their clothing. For if you take the name
only, and do not receive the clothing from them, you will get no
benefit, for these girls are powers of the Son of God. If you
bear the name, but do not bear his power, you will be bearing
his name in vain.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“And the stones,” said he, “that you saw rejected, are the ones
that have borne the name, but did not put on the clothing of
the girls.”</p>

<p>“What kind of clothing have they, sir?” said I.</p>

<p>“Their very names,” said he, “are their clothing. Whoever bears
the name of the Son of God ought also to bear their names, for
even the Son himself bears the names of these girls.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“All the stones,” said he, “that you saw go into the building
of the tower, handed over by their hands and remaining in the
building, are clothed with the power of these girls. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>That is why
you see that the tower has become one stone with the rock. So
those who have believed the Lord through his Son and clothe
<span class="pb" id="page_185"><b class="pb">{Page 185}</b></span>
themselves with these spirits will become one spirit and one
body, and their garments will be of one colour. And the home
of such as bear the names of the girls is in the tower.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>“Why then, sir,” said I, “were the rejected stones rejected?
For they passed through the gateway and were put into the structure
of the tower by the girls’ hands.”</p>

<p>“Since you are concerned about it all,” said he, “and inquire
closely, hear about the rejected stones. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>All these,” said he, “took
the name of the Son of God, and they also received the power
of these girls. So they received these spirits and were made strong
and were with the slaves of God, and they had one spirit and
one body and one clothing, for they were in agreement and did
what was right. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Then after a while they were seduced by the
women you saw clad in black clothing, who had their shoulders
exposed and their hair down and were well formed. On seeing
them they desired them and put on their power, and laid aside
the clothing and power of the girls. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>So these men have been cast
out of the house of God and turned over to those women. But
those who were not deceived by the beauty of these women
stayed in the house of God. That,” said he, “is the explanation
of the ones that were rejected.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>“What then, sir,” said I, “if these men, being what they are,
repent and cast off their desires of these women, and return to
the girls, and live in their power and acts? Will they not enter
the house of God?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“They will,” said he, “if they renounce the acts of these
women, and take back the power of the girls and live in their
ways. For that is why there was an interruption of the building,
so that if they repent they may go back into the structure of
the tower. But if they do not repent, then others will go in, and
they themselves will be finally cast out.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>I gave thanks to the Lord for all these things, because he has
had mercy on all those who call upon his name and has sent the
angel of repentance to us who had sinned against him, and has
<span class="pb" id="page_186"><b class="pb">{Page 186}</b></span>
renewed our spirit, and when we were already destroyed and
had no hope of living, he has revived our life.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Well, sir,” said I, “show me why the tower was built not on
the ground but on the rock, and on the gateway.”</p>

<p>“Are you still stupid and foolish?” said he.</p>

<p>“I am obliged, sir,” said I, “to ask you everything, for I cannot
understand anything at all. For all great, glorious things are hard
for men to understand.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Listen,” said he. “The name of the Son of God is great and
incomprehensible and sustains the whole world. So if all creation
is sustained by the Son of God, what do you think of those who
have been called by him, and bear the name of the Son of God,
and live by his commands? <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Do you see, then, what kind of people
he sustains? Those who bear his name with their whole hearts.
So he has become their foundation, and gladly sustains them,
because they are not ashamed to bear his name.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>“Tell me, sir,” said I, “the names of the girls and of the women
who are wearing the black clothes.”</p>

<p>“Hear the names,” said he, “of the strongest girls who stood at
the corners. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The first is Faith, the second, Self-control, the third,
Strength, and the fourth, Patience. And the others who stood
between them, bear these names: Sincerity, Innocence, Purity,
Cheerfulness, Truth, Understanding, Harmony, Love. The man
that bears these names and the name of the Son of God will be
able to enter the kingdom of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Hear also,” said he, “the names
of the women with the black clothes. Of these also four are most
powerful. The first is Unbelief, the second, Impurity, the third,
Disobedience, and the fourth, Deceit. And the ones that follow
them are called Grief, Wickedness, Wantonness, Ill temper,
Falsehood, Folly, Slander, Hatred. The slave of God who bears
these names will see the kingdom of God, but he will not
enter it.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“But, sir,” said I, “who are the stones that were fitted into the
building from the deep place?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_187"><b class="pb">{Page 187}</b></span></p>

<p>“The first ones,” said he, “the ten that were put into the foundations,
are the first generation, and the twenty-five are the second
generation of upright men, and the thirty-five are the prophets
of God and his servants, and the forty are apostles and teachers
of the preaching of the Son of God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Why, then, sir,” said I, “did the girls hand over these stones
also for the building of this tower, after carrying them through
the gateway?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “they were the first to hear these spirits,
and did not part from one another at all, neither the spirits from
the men nor the men from the spirits, but the spirits stayed with
them till they fell asleep. And if they had not had these spirits
with them, they would not have been of use for the building
of the tower.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>“Tell me still more, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“What more do you ask?” said he.</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” said I, “did the stones come up from the deep
place and why were they put into the building of the tower,
though they had borne these spirits?”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“They had to come up through water,” said he, “to be made
alive, for they could not enter the kingdom of God in any other
way than by laying aside the deadness of their former life. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So
even those who had fallen asleep received the seal of the Son of
God, and entered the kingdom of God. For,” said he, “before the
man bears the name of the Son of God, he is dead, but when he
receives the seal, he lays aside his deadness and receives life. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So
the water is the seal. So they go down into the water dead, and
they come up alive. So this seal was preached to them also, and
they took advantage of it, in order to enter the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Why, sir,” said I, “did the forty stones also come up with them
from the deep place, when they had had the seal already?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said he, “these apostles and teachers who had
preached the name of the Son of God, when they fell asleep in
the power and faith of the Son of God, preached also to those
<span class="pb" id="page_188"><b class="pb">{Page 188}</b></span>
who had previously fallen asleep, and themselves gave them the
seal of the preaching. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So they went down with them into the
water, and came up again. But these went down alive, and came
up alive, but those who had previously fallen asleep went down
dead and came up alive. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>So they were made alive through them,
and came to know the name of the Son of God. That is why
they also came up with them, and were fitted together with
them into the building of the tower, and were built together
without being shaped. For they had fallen asleep in uprightness,
and great purity, only they had not had this seal. That is the
explanation of these things.”</p>

<p>“It is, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">17 </b>“Now, then, sir, tell me about the mountains; why are their
aspects some of one kind and some of another, and diverse?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “These twelve mountains are the tribes that
inhabit the whole world. So the Son of God was preached to
them by the apostles.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“But tell me, sir, why the mountains are diverse, and one has
one aspect and another another.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “These twelve tribes that inhabit the whole
world are twelve nations, and they are diverse in thought and
mind. So just as you saw that the mountains were diverse, there
are diversities of mind and thought among these nations, and
I will tell you the operation of each one.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“First, sir,” said I, “tell me this: why, when the mountains
are so diverse, when the stones from them were set in the building,
they became bright, and of one colour, like the stones that
came up from the deep.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Because,” said he, “all the nations that live under heaven,
when they have heard and believed, are called by the name of
the Son of God. So when they have received the seal, they have
come to have one thought and one mind, and to possess one
faith and one love, and they have come to bear the spirits of
the girls with the name. That is why the structure of the tower
<span class="pb" id="page_189"><b class="pb">{Page 189}</b></span>
became of one colour, as bright as the sun. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But since they went
in together and became one body, some of them have defiled
themselves, and been cast out of the race of the upright, and
again become as they were before, or rather even worse.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">18 </b>“How, sir,” said I, “did they become worse, when they had
come to know God?”</p>

<p>“The man,” said he, “who does not know God, and does wrong,
receives some punishment for his wrongdoing, but the man who
has come to know God ought not to do wrong, but to do right.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>So if the man who ought to do right does wrong, does he not
seem to do much greater wrong than the man who does not know
God? That is why those who do not know God and do wrong
are condemned to death, but those who know God and have seen
his mighty acts, and yet do wrong, will be doubly punished and
die forever. So in this way the church of God will be purified.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“But as you saw the stones taken from the tower, and handed
over to the evil spirits and cast out of it (and there will be one
body of those who are purified, just as the tower became as
though made of one stone, after it had been purified), so the
church of God will be, after it has been purified, and the wicked
and hypocrites and blasphemers and doubters and doers of
different kinds of wickedness are cast out. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>After these have been
cast out, the church of God will be one body, one thought, one
mind, one faith, one love, and then the Son of God will rejoice
and be glad over them, when he has taken his people back pure.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“It is all great and wonderful, sir,” said I. “In addition, sir,”
said I, “tell me the force and function of each of the mountains,
so that every soul that trusts in the Lord may hear it, and glorify
his great, wonderful, glorious name.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he, “to the diversity of the mountains and of
the twelve nations.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">19 </b>“Those who believed from the first mountain, the black one,
are such men as these: apostates and blasphemers of the Lord,
and betrayers of the slaves of God. For them there is no repentance,
<span class="pb" id="page_190"><b class="pb">{Page 190}</b></span>
but there is death, and that is why they are black, for their
race is lawless.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“And those who believed from the second mountain, the bare
one, are such men as these: hypocrites and teachers of wickedness.
So these are like the preceding ones, for they have no fruit
of uprightness. For as their mountain was without fruit, so such
men have the name, but are devoid of faith, and there is no
fruit of truth in them. So there is repentance for these, if they
repent quickly, but if they delay, their death will be with the
preceding ones.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Why, sir,” said I, “is there repentance for these, but not for
the first ones? For their actions are almost the same.”</p>

<p>“This,” said he, “is why these can have repentance—because
they have not blasphemed their Lord, or been betrayers of the
slaves of God, but because of their desire for gain they have
acted hypocritically, and each taught to suit the desires of sinful
men. But they will pay a penalty, though repentance is open
to them, because they have not been blasphemers or betrayers.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">20 </b>“And those who believed from the third mountain, which had
thorns and briers, are such men as these: some of them are
rich, and some are involved in many business affairs; the briers
are the rich, and the thorns those involved in different kinds
of business. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So these who are involved in many different kinds of
business do not associate with the slaves of God, but are choked
by what they are doing, and led astray. And the rich find it
hard to associate with the slaves of God, for they fear that they
will ask them for something. So such men will find it hard to
enter the kingdom of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For just as it is hard to walk barefooted
among briers, it is hard for such men to enter the kingdom
of God. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But there is repentance for all these, but speedy
repentance, so that they may retrace the days and make amends
for what they failed to do in former times, and accomplish
some good. So if they repent and accomplish some good, they
will live to God, but if they persist in their conduct, they will
<span class="pb" id="page_191"><b class="pb">{Page 191}</b></span>
be turned over to those women, who will put them to death.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">21 </b>“And those who believed from the fourth mountain, which
had much vegetation, which was green at the tops but dry
near the roots, and some of it dried up by the sun, are such
men as these: some are doubters, and others have the Lord
upon their lips, but do not have him in their hearts. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>That is
why their foundations are dry and have no strength, and only
their words are alive, but their actions are dead. Such men are
neither alive nor dead. So they are like the doubters, for the
doubters are neither green nor dry, for they are neither alive
nor dead. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For just as these plants when they saw the sun were
dried up, so the doubters, when they hear of persecution, because
of their cowardice worship idols and are ashamed of their
Lord’s name. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>So such men are neither alive nor dead. But
these too, if they repent quickly, will be able to live. But if they
do not repent, they are already turned over to the women who
take away their lives.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">22 </b>“And those who believed from the fifth mountain, which had
green vegetation and was rough, are such men as these: they
are believers, but are slow to learn, and self-willed and pleasing
themselves, wanting to know everything, and yet they know
nothing at all. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Because of this self-will of theirs, understanding
has left them, and stupid folly has taken possession of them,
and they praise themselves for having intelligence and want to
be volunteer teachers, foolish as they are. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So because of this
arrogance many through exalting themselves have been humbled,
for self-will and overconfidence are a great demon. So many
of these were rejected, but some repented and believed, and
submitted to those who had understanding, perceiving their
own foolishness. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And for the rest of such people, repentance
is open, for they have not been wicked, but foolish and without
understanding instead. So if these men repent, they will
live to God, but if they do not, they will live with the women
who mean to do them evil.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_192"><b class="pb">{Page 192}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">23 </b>And those who believed from the sixth mountain, which had
great and small fissures in it, and withered plants in the fissures,
are such men as these. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The ones that hold the small fissures
are those who hold grudges against one another, and they are
withered in faith from their own slanders. But many of them
have repented, and the rest will repent when they hear my
commands. For their slanders are small, and they will soon
repent. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the ones occupying the large fissures are those who
persist in their slanders and rage vengefully at one another. So
these have been thrown away from the tower, and rejected
from the building of it. Such men will find it hard to live. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>If
our God and Lord, who rules over all, and has authority over
his whole creation, holds no grudge against those who confess
their sins, but is merciful, can a man who is mortal and full of
sins hold a grudge against a man, as though he could destroy
or save him? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But I, the angel of repentance, tell you, all who
hold this way of thinking must lay it aside and repent, and the
Lord will heal your previous sins, if you cleanse yourselves
from this demon. But if you do not, you will be handed over to
him, to die.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">24 </b>“And those who believed from the seventh mountain, on
which there were gay, green plants, and the whole mountain
was flourishing, and all kinds of cattle and wild birds were
feeding on the plants on this mountain, and the plants on which
they fed became all the more luxuriant, are such men as these:
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>they were always sincere and without guile, and blessed, holding
nothing against one another, but always rejoicing in the
slaves of God and clad in the holy Spirit of these girls, and
always feeling compassion for every man, and from their labours
they provided for every man without reproach or hesitation.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the Lord, seeing their sincerity and perfect innocence, prospered
them in the labours of their hands and showed them
favor in all that they did. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And I, the angel of repentance, tell you
who are such men, continue to be such, and your descendants
<span class="pb" id="page_193"><b class="pb">{Page 193}</b></span>
will never be blotted out. For the Lord has tested you and has
enrolled you in our number, and all your descendants will live
with the Son of God, for you have partaken of his spirit.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">25 </b>“And those who believed from the eighth mountain, where
there were many springs and all the Lord’s creation was
watered from the springs, are such men as these: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>apostles and
teachers who have preached to the whole world, and have taught
the word of the Lord reverently and purely and have kept nothing
at all back for evil desire, but always lived in uprightness
and truth, just as they had received the holy Spirit. Such men
will go in with the angels.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">26 </b>“And those who believed from the ninth mountain, which was
desert, which had reptiles and wild animals that destroy men
on it, are such men as these: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>the ones that were spotted are
deacons who served badly and plundered the living of widows
and orphans, and made profit for themselves from the ministry
they had accepted to perform. So if they persist in the same
desire, they are dead and have no hope of life. But if they
turn and perform their service purely, they will be able to live.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the ones that are scaly are those that have denied and
have not returned to their Lord, but have become barren and
desert; in not associating with the slaves of God, but keeping
to themselves, they are destroying their own souls. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For just as a
vine left uncared for inside an enclosure is ruined and wasted
by weeds and eventually becomes wild and is no longer of any
use to its owner, so men such as these have despaired and growing
wild have become useless to their Lord. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>So there is repentance
for these men, unless they are found to have denied from
their hearts. But if anyone is found to have denied from his
heart, I do not know whether he can live. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And I do not say this
for it is impossible for a man who shall now deny his Lord to be
saved, but repentance seems to be available for those who
denied long ago. So if anyone is going to repent, let him be
quick to do so before the tower is finished, or else he will be destroyed
<span class="pb" id="page_194"><b class="pb">{Page 194}</b></span>
and put to death by the women. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And the short ones are
deceivers and slanderers, and they are the wild animals that you
saw on the mountain. For just as the wild animals with their
poison destroy man and kill him, so such men’s words destroy
man and kill him. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>So these men are short in their faith because
of their behaviour to one another, but some have repented and
been saved. And the others who are of this kind can be saved if
they repent, but if they do not repent, they will die at the hands
of those women whose power they have.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">27 </b>And those who believed from the tenth mountain, where
trees were sheltering some sheep, are such men as these: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>bishops
and hospitable men who were always glad to welcome the slaves
of God into their homes without hypocrisy, and the bishops
always unfailingly sheltered the needy and the widows by their
ministry, and always conducted themselves purely. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So all these
will always be sheltered by the Lord. So those who have done
these things are in honour with God, and their place is already
with the angels if they continue to serve the Lord to the end.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">28 </b>“And those who believed from the eleventh mountain, where
there were trees full of fruit, one adorned with one fruit and
another with another, are such men as these: <sup class="verse">2 </sup>those who have
suffered for the name of the Son of God, who have suffered willingly
with all their hearts, and laid down their lives.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Then why, sir,” said I, “do all the trees have fruit, but the fruits
of some of them are better-looking?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he. “All who have ever suffered for the name
are glorious in the sight of God, and the sins of all of them have
been taken away, because they have suffered for the name of the
Son of God. But hear why their fruits are of different kinds and
some superior to others. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>All,” said he, “who, when brought before
the authorities, have been questioned and have not denied but
suffered willingly are in greater honour in the sight of God; the
superior fruit is theirs. But of all those that were cowardly and
hesitated, and debated in their minds whether they should deny
<span class="pb" id="page_195"><b class="pb">{Page 195}</b></span>
or confess, and suffered, the fruits are inferior, because this
thought occurred to them, for it is a wicked thought that a slave
should deny his master.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Take care, then, you who have these thoughts, that this thought
does not remain in your minds and you die to God. But you
who suffer for the name ought to glorify God because God has
thought you worthy to bear this name and to have all your sins
healed. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So count yourselves happy, but consider that you have
done a great deed if one of you suffers for the sake of God. The
Lord is offering you life, and you do not perceive it, for your sins
have weighed you down, and if you had not suffered for the name
of the Lord, you would have died to God on account of your
sins. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>I say this to you who are in doubt about denying or confessing:
Confess that you have a Master, so that you may not deny
him and be thrown into prison. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>If the heathen punish their slaves
if one of them denies his master, what do you suppose the Lord
who has authority over all will do to you? Put these thoughts out
of your minds so that you may live to God forever.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">29 </b>“And from the twelfth mountain, which was white, those who
believed are such men as these: They are like veritable babes,
into whose minds no evil comes, and they do not know what
wickedness is, but have always continued in innocence. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Such
people therefore will undoubtedly live in the Kingdom of God,
because they have not by any act profaned God’s commands, but
have continued in innocence all the days of their lives in the same
attitude of mind. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>All of you, then, who will continue,” said he,
“and will be like babes, with no wickedness, will be more
glorious than all those who have been mentioned before, for all
babes are glorious in the sight of God, and are foremost with
him. So blessed are you who put off wickedness from yourselves,
and put on innocence; you will be first of all to live to God.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>After he finished the parables of the mountains, I said to him,</p>

<p>“Sir, now explain to me about the stones that were taken away
from the plain and put in the building in place of the stones that
<span class="pb" id="page_196"><b class="pb">{Page 196}</b></span>
were taken out of the tower, and the round stones that were put
into the building, and those that are still round.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">30 </b>“Hear,” said he, “about all these also. These stones of the plain
that were taken and put into the building of the tower, in place
of the ones that were rejected, are the roots of the white
mountain. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So since those who believed from the white mountain
were all found innocent, the master of the tower ordered them
to be taken from the roots of this mountain to the building of
the tower. For he knew that if these stones went into the building
of the tower, they would remain bright and none of them
would turn black. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But if he had put in those from the other
mountains, he would have had to visit the tower again, and to
clean it. But all those who have believed and are going to believe
have been found to be white, for they belong to the same
race. Blessed is that race, for it is innocent! <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Now hear about the
stones that are round and bright. They too are all from the
white mountain. Hear why they were found round. Their riches
have clouded them a little from the truth and darkened them,
but they have never forsaken God, and no evil word has gone out
of their mouths, but it was all justice and the virtue of truth.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>So when the Lord saw that their minds were able to favour the
truth and to remain good, he ordered their wealth to be reduced,
but not to be wholly taken away, so that they could do some good
with what was left to them, and they will live to God, since they
belong to the good race. So they have been cut down a little and
put into the building of the tower.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">31 </b>“But the rest, which were still round and had not been fitted
into the building, because they had not received the seal, were
put back in their former place, for they were found to be quite
round. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But this world and the vanities of their possessions must
be cut off from them, and then they will be fit for the kingdom of
God. For they must enter the kingdom of God, for this innocent
race the Lord blessed. So no one of this race will perish. For
although one of them, tempted by a most wicked devil, does
<span class="pb" id="page_197"><b class="pb">{Page 197}</b></span>
something wrong, he will quickly return to his Lord. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I, the angel
of repentance, declare all of you happy who are as innocent as
babes, because your part is good and honourable in God’s sight.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>But I tell all of you who have received the seal, to preserve your
sincerity, and hold no grudges, and not to persist in your wickedness,
or in the bitter memory of your offences, but to be each one
of one spirit, and harmonize these evil divisions and put them
away from you, so that the owner of the flocks may rejoice in
them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And he will rejoice, if they are all found in good health,
and none of them scattered. But if some of them are found
scattered, alas for the shepherds! <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And if the shepherds themselves
are found scattered, what will they say to the owner of the flock?
That they have been scattered by the sheep? They will not be believed,
for it is an incredible thing that a shepherd should be hurt
by the sheep. They will be punished for their lie, instead. I, too,
am a shepherd, and must most certainly give an account for you.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">32 </b>“Reform therefore while the tower is still being built. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The Lord
lives among peace-loving men, for peace is really dear to him, but
he is far from quarrelsome people and men abandoned to wickedness.
So give your spirits back to him whole, as you received
them. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For if you give a cleaner a new garment whole, and want
to get it back again whole, but the cleaner returns it to you torn,
will you accept it? Will you not immediately blaze up, and pursue
him with abuse and say, ‘I gave you a whole garment; why
did you tear it and make it useless? Because of the tear you have
made in it, it cannot be used.’ Will you not say all these things
to the cleaner, just about a tear he has made in your garment?
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>If, then, you grieve so over your garment, and complain because
you do not get it back whole, what do you suppose the Lord will
do to you, who gave you the spirit whole, and you return it entirely
useless, so that it cannot be of any use to its owner, for its
use began to be useless when it was spoiled by you. Will not the
owner of that spirit on account of this act of yours punish you
with death?”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_198"><b class="pb">{Page 198}</b></span></p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Surely,” said I, “he will punish all those whom he finds cherishing
the memory of their wrongs.”</p>

<p>“Do not trample on his mercy,” said he, “but honour him
instead, because he is so patient with your offences, and is not
like you. Show a repentance that will profit you.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">33 </b>“All these things that are written above, I, the shepherd, the
angel of repentance, have shown and told to the slaves of God.
If therefore you believe and listen to my words and follow them
and mend your ways, you will be able to live. But if you persist
in wickedness and in holding grudges, no one of that kind will
live to God. All these things that I had to tell you have been told
you.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>The shepherd himself said to me,</p>

<p>“Have you asked me everything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“Then why did you not ask me about the marks of the stones
that were put in the building, why we filled up the marks?”</p>

<p>“I forgot, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Then hear now,” said he, “about them. They are those who
have now heard my commands and have repented with all their
hearts. And when the Lord had seen that their repentance was
good and pure, and that they could continue in it, he ordered their
former sins to be wiped out. For these marks were their sins, and
they have been smoothed out so that they should not show.”</p>

<h4>PARABLE X</h4>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>After I had written this book, the angel who had turned me
over to the shepherd came to the house where I was, and sat
down upon the couch, and the shepherd stood at his right. Then
he called me and said to me,</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“I have turned you and your household over to this shepherd,”
said he, “so that you may be protected by him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_199"><b class="pb">{Page 199}</b></span></p>

<p>“So if you want to be protected,” said he, “from all annoyance
and cruelty, and to succeed in every good work and word, and
to have every upright virtue, live in accordance with his commands
which I gave you, and you will be able to overcome all
wickedness. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For if you keep his commands, every desire and enjoyment
of this world will be subject to you, but in every good
undertaking success will attend you. Take upon yourself his ripe
understanding and restraint, and tell all men that he is greatly
honoured and esteemed with the Lord, and is a defender of great
power and mighty in his authority. He alone has been given
authority over repentance throughout the whole world. Does he
seem to you to be powerful? Yet you despise his ripe understanding
and the modesty that he shows toward you.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>I said to him,</p>

<p>“Ask him himself, sir, whether since he has been in my house
I have done anything against his orders, so as to offend him.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“I know myself,” said he, “that you have not done anything and
will not do anything against his orders. And so I tell you this,
so that you may keep on. For he has thought well of you, he
tells me. But you must tell the others these things, so that they
too who have repented or are going to repent, may think as you
do, and he may give a good report of them to me and I may to the
Lord.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“I myself, sir,” said I, “tell every man the mighty deeds of the
Lord, but I hope that all who have sinned before, if they hear
these things, will be glad to repent and regain life.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“Then continue in this service,” said he, “and complete it. All
who carry out his commands will have life, and the man who does
so will have great honour with the Lord. But all who do not keep
his commands are fleeing from their own life and against him,
and they do not follow his commands, but give themselves up to
death, and every one of them is guilty of his own blood. But I
tell you to keep his commands and you will have the curing of
your sins.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_200"><b class="pb">{Page 200}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>“But I sent these girls to you to live with you, for I saw that they
were agreeable to you. So you have them as helpers, so that you
may be better able to keep these commands, for it is not possible
that these commands be kept without these girls. I see moreover
that they like to be with you, but I will instruct them not to
leave your house at all. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Only you must make your house clean,
for they will be glad to live in a clean house, for they are clean
and chaste and industrious, and they all have favour with the
Lord. So if they find your house clean, they will stay with you.
But if any bit of impurity happens, they will leave your house
at once, for these girls love no impurity at all.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“I hope I shall please them, sir,” I said to him, “so that they
will always be glad to live in my house, and just as he to whom
you turned me over has no fault to find with me, they will not
either.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>He said to the shepherd,</p>

<p>“I know that the slave of God wants to live, and will keep these
commands, and will support the girls in purity.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>With these words he turned me over to the shepherd again,
and calling the girls he said to them,</p>

<p>“Since I see that you like to live in his house, I entrust him
and his house to you; do not leave his house at all.” And they
were glad to hear these words.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Then he said to me,</p>

<p>“Be brave in this service. Show every man the mighty deeds
of the Lord, and you will find favour in this service. Whoever
therefore follows these commands will live, and will be happy in
his life, but whoever neglects them will not live, and will be unhappy
in his life. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Tell all men who can do right not to stop; the
practice of good deeds is good for them. Further, I declare that
every man ought to be rescued from distress. For the man who is
in want and suffers distress in his daily life is in great misery and
hardship. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the man who rescues such a soul from misery wins
great joy for himself. For the man who is harassed by such distress
<span class="pb" id="page_201"><b class="pb">{Page 201}</b></span>
endures such torture as a man does who is in chains. For
many, on account of such calamities, when they cannot endure
them, bring death upon themselves. So the man who knows of
the misery of such a man and does not rescue him commits a
great sin, and becomes guilty of his blood.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>“So do good, all of you who have learned from the Lord, or
while you put off doing it the tower may be finished, for it is on
your account that the work of building has been interrupted. So
unless you make haste to do right, the tower will be finished and
you will be shut out of it.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>After he had talked with me, he got up from the couch, and
taking the shepherd and the girls went away, telling me, however,
that he would send the shepherd and the girls back to my house.</p>

<h2>The Letters of Ignatius</h2>

<p>Early in the second century Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, was
condemned to death and taken to Rome to be thrown to the lions
in the Coliseum. As he passed through the province of Asia, he
was welcomed by groups from the churches on his way, at
Philadelphia and Smyrna, and churches on the alternative route
through Tralles, Magnesia, and Ephesus sent delegations to
Smyrna to greet him. To all these churches he later wrote letters
of acknowledgement, urging them to combat the Docetic heresy
then rife in Asia, and to stand by their bishops. The leading
bishops, Onesimus of Ephesus and Polycarp of Smyrna, were
active in cheering him on his way, and with an Ephesian deacon
named Burrhus did all they could to help him with his letters. In
fact, as Ignatius seems to have written nothing enduring before
reaching Smyrna, or after parting with Burrhus at Troas, it seems
likely that he wrote largely at their instance. Ephesus was in
that generation the literary centre of Christianity—consider
probably Ephesians, the Pauline letter collection, the Revelation,
the Gospel and Letters of John, the fourfold gospel—and it
would be natural for them to encourage Ignatius to throw his
great influence as a Christian confessor and prospective martyr
against the most threatening heresy of their day. Not only did
Onesimus bring Burrhus, evidently a competent scribe, from
Ephesus to do Ignatius’ writing for him, but Polycarp afterward
made it his business to circulate what he wrote, as his Letter to
<span class="pb" id="page_204"><b class="pb">{Page 204}</b></span>
the Philippians, written immediately after Ignatius’ departure
from Smyrna, shows. The survival of the sevenfold corpus of
Ignatius’ letters also points to such activity on the part of his
episcopal sponsors. And Ignatius’ literary style is not at all that
of a man accustomed to written composition. Moreover, the
collection comes from the very time when the Christian public,
especially in Asia, was awakening to the enormous possibilities
of book publication in the promotion of their great enterprise.</p>

<p>From Smyrna Ignatius wrote letters of exhortation and instruction
to the churches of Ephesus, Magnesia, and Tralles, which
had sent delegations to welcome and cheer him, and to the church
at Rome, to prepare its members for his coming, and urge them
to make no efforts for his release. The longest one, his letter to
the Ephesians, is about the length of Paul’s Letter to the Colossians.
They reveal a man deeply attached to the basic realities
of Christian experience, heroically adjusting himself to the prospect
of certain, violent death, and warning the Asian churches
against the delusions of Docetism. Ignatius is also a strong
advocate of the threefold ministry, bishops, elders or presbyters,
and deacons.</p>

<p>Hurried on by his guards to Troas, but still accompanied by
the faithful Burrhus, he wrote from that port letters to the
Philadelphians, to the Smyrnaeans, and to Polycarp, the bishop
of Smyrna, who had so signally befriended him. From Troas he
was taken to Neapolis and Philippi, and there Ignatius finally
disappears from our view. Like so many others, he doubtless
suffered martyrdom in the Coliseum, Eusebius says in A.D. 107-108,
but modern learning inclines to about A.D. 110-117.</p>

<p>The letter written by Polycarp to the church at Philippi, soon
after Ignatius left there, indicates that while at Philippi Ignatius
suggested to the Philippians that copies of his letters, or some
of them, could be obtained from Polycarp at Smyrna, so that it
<span class="pb" id="page_205"><b class="pb">{Page 205}</b></span>
is evident that the letters were not only sent to the churches
addressed, but copies of them were preserved at Smyrna for
wider distribution. That is to say, at least a limited publication
of them took place at once, and it is decidedly probable that it
was with this in view that Onesimus and Polycarp encouraged
and helped Ignatius to write them, to aid in their campaign
against the dangers of Docetism.</p>

<p>The seven Ignatian letters have had an extraordinary history,
having been reduced in Syriac to three greatly abbreviated ones
and, on the other hand, in Greek and Latin having been increased
as a collection by the addition of six or more spurious letters, or
individually expanded and interpolated, still accompanied by
several spurious letters. But the list of seven given in Eusebius
in A.D. 326, and known to us in the shorter Greek form, it is now
generally agreed, is the original Ignatian corpus.</p>

<h2>The Letters of Ignatius</h2>

<h3>To the Ephesians</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to the deservedly happy church
at Ephesus in Asia, blest in size by the full experience of God
the Father, foreordained from eternity for enduring, unchanging
glory for ever, unalterably united and chosen through true suffering
by the will of the Father and Jesus Christ our God, heartiest
greeting in Jesus Christ and in blameless joy.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>I have through God approved your well-beloved name which
you bear by reason of your upright nature, by faith and love in
Christ Jesus our Saviour. You are followers of God’s example, and
rekindling your proper task by the blood of God, you have finished
it perfectly. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For when you heard that I was on my way from
Syria in chains for our common name and hope, in the hope of
being permitted to fight wild beasts in Rome in order that by
being permitted by your prayer I might be able to be a disciple,
you were eager to see me. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Since therefore I have received your
whole congregation in the name of God, in the person of Onesimus,
a man of inexpressible love, and your bishop in the flesh, I
pray that you will love him in Jesus Christ, and will all of you be
like him. For blessed is he who has favoured you, worthy as you
are, with having such a bishop.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>As to my fellow slave Burrhus, by the will of God your deacon
blessed in all things, I beg that he stay on with me, to the honour
of yourselves and the bishop. And Crocus too, who is worthy of
God and of you, in whom I have received an example of your
<span class="pb" id="page_208"><b class="pb">{Page 208}</b></span>
love, has refreshed me in every way; may the Father of Jesus
Christ refresh him so! With him came Onesimus and Burrhus and
Euplus and Fronto, in whom I have seen you all in love. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>May I
have profit of you always, if I am worthy. So it is proper for you
in every way to glorify Jesus Christ, who has glorified you, so that
you may be united in a common subjection to the bishop and the
body of elders, and be wholly sanctified.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>I do not order you as though I were somebody. For though I
am in chains for the name, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ.
For now I am beginning to be a disciple, and I speak to you as
my schoolmates. For I needed to be rubbed down by you with
faith, exhortation, endurance, patience. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But since love does not
allow me to be silent about you, I have on that account hurried
to exhort you to run your race in harmony with the mind of God.
For Jesus Christ, our inseparable life is the mind of the Father,
just as the bishops who are appointed all over the world are in the
mind of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>Hence it is proper for you to run your race in harmony with
the mind of the bishop, just as you are doing. For your deserving
body of elders, worthy of God, is attuned to the bishop as the
strings are to the harp. Therefore in your agreement and harmonious
love Jesus Christ is being praised. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You must every man of
you join in a choir so that being harmonious and in concord and
taking the keynote of God in unison, you may sing with one
voice through Jesus Christ to the Father, so that he may hear
you and through your good deeds recognize that you are parts
of his Son. So it is advantageous for you to be in blameless unity,
so that you always share in God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>For if I in a short time have come to have such intimacy with
your bishop, which was not human but spiritual, how much more
do I think you happy who have been mingled with him as the
church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father,
so that all things may unite in harmony. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let no one deceive himself;
unless a man is inside the altar, he is in want of the bread of
<span class="pb" id="page_209"><b class="pb">{Page 209}</b></span>
God. For if the prayer of one or two has such power, how much
more that of the bishop and the whole church has! <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the man
who does not come to church is proud already, and has separated
himself. For it is written, “God opposes the proud.” So let us be
zealous not to oppose the bishop, so that we may be submissive
to God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>And the more anyone sees the bishop silent, the more let him
revere him, for anyone whom the head of the house sends on
business of his own we ought to welcome as we would the one
who sent him. So it is clear that we must look upon the bishop
as the Lord himself. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So Onesimus himself praises highly your
good discipline in God, for you all live in the light of the truth,
and no sect has any lodging among you; why, you will not even
continue to listen to anyone, even though you do to Jesus Christ
who speaks in truth.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>For some are in the habit of making the name known in wicked
deceit, while they do some things unworthy of God. You must
turn away from them as you would from wild beasts, for they
are mad dogs, who bite by stealth. You must be on your guard
against them, for they are hard to heal. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>There is one physician,
of flesh and of spirit, born and unborn, God become incarnate,
true life in death, sprung from Mary and from God, first subject
to suffering and then free from suffering, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>So let no one deceive you, as indeed you are not deceived, for
you belong wholly to God. For when no quarrel, which might torment
you, has gained a foothold among you, you are indeed living
in God’s way. I am your humble sacrifice, dedicated for you
Ephesians, a church renowned forever. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Those who are of the
flesh cannot do spiritual things, nor can those who are spiritual
do the things of the flesh, just as faith cannot do the deeds of
unbelief, nor unbelief the deeds of faith. But even what you do
in the flesh is spiritual, for you do everything in union with Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>But I have learned that some men have visited you from outside,
<span class="pb" id="page_210"><b class="pb">{Page 210}</b></span>
and brought you an evil teaching, though you did not allow
them to scatter it among you, but closed your ears, so that you
might not receive what they scattered, since you are like stones
of a temple of the Father, prepared for the building of God the
Father, hoisted up on high by the crane of Jesus Christ, that is,
the cross, using the holy Spirit for a rope. Your faith is your windlass
and love is the road that leads up to God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So you are all
travelling companions, carrying God and temple, and Christ and
your sacred things, and being fully arrayed in the commands of
Jesus Christ. In this I rejoice that I have been thought worthy
through what I write to converse with you and congratulate you
that following another way of life you love nothing but God
alone.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Pray constantly for other men, also, for in their case there is a
hope of repentance, that they may find God. Permit them to be
instructed by you, at least through your deeds. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>To their anger,
be meek; to their boasts, be humble; to their abuse, utter your
prayers; to their error, be steadfast in faith; to their savagery, be
gentle; not zealous to imitate them. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Let us show ourselves their
brothers by forbearance, and let us be zealous to imitate the Lord,
to see who can be more wronged, defrauded, set at naught, so
that no plant of the devil may be found in you, but with all purity
and sobriety you may remain in union with Jesus Christ, in both
flesh and spirit.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>These are the last times; so let us feel shame, let us fear the patience
of God, that it may not result in our condemnation. For
let us either fear the wrath that is to come or love the grace
that now is, one or the other; only let us be found in union with
Christ Jesus, to live the true life. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let nothing attract you apart
from him in union with whom I wear my chains, these spiritual
pearls with which may I rise again through your prayer, in which
may I always share, so that I may be found in the class of the
Christians of Ephesus who were always in accord with the
apostles, by the power of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_211"><b class="pb">{Page 211}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>I know who I am and to whom I am writing. I am condemned,
you have received mercy. I am in danger, you are secure. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You are
the approach for those who are put to death on their way to God,
fellow initiates of Paul, who has been sanctified, and died a
martyr, deservedly happy, in whose footsteps may I be found
when I reach the presence of God; who in every letter recalls you,
in union with Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>So be zealous to meet together more frequently to give thanks
to God and glorify him. For when you meet together frequently,
Satan’s powers are destroyed and his destructiveness comes to
naught through the harmony of your faith. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>There is nothing better
than peace, by which every war of beings in heaven or on earth
is nullified.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>None of these things can escape you if you have perfect faith
and love for Jesus Christ, which are the beginning and the end
of life; faith is the beginning and love the end. And when the two
are united they are God, and everything else that contributes to
character follows them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>No one who professes faith sins, or who
possesses love hates. The tree is known by its fruit, and similarly
those who profess to belong to Christ will be recognized by what
they do. For it is not a matter of what we now profess, but that
a man continue in the power of faith to the end.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>It is better to be silent and be, than to talk and not be. It is
good to teach, if the speaker does so. So there is one teacher, who
spoke and it was done, and even what he did silently was worthy
of the Father. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The man who is really possessed of the word of
Jesus can hear even his silence, so that he may be perfect, so
that he may act through what he says and be known through his
silence. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Nothing is hidden from the Lord, but even our secrets are
near him. So let us do everything with a sense that he is dwelling
within us, so that we may be his temples, and he be within as
our God, as he really is, and as will appear before our eyes from
the love we justly have for him.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_212"><b class="pb">{Page 212}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>Do not be misled, my brethren; adulterers cannot inherit the
kingdom of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>If, then, those who do these things in the flesh
are dead, how much more if by evil teaching a man corrupts faith
in God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such a man, vile as
he is, will go to the unquenchable fire, and so will the man that
listens to him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">17 </b>It was for this reason that the Lord let the ointment be put
upon his head—that he might breathe incorruptibility upon the
church. Do not be anointed with the foul smell of the teaching of
the ruler of this world, so that he may not capture us from the
life that lies before us. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And why are we not all sensible, when we
have received the knowledge of God, which is Jesus Christ? Why
do we foolishly perish, ignoring the free gift which the Lord has
really sent us?</p>

<p><b class="chapter">18 </b>My spirit is a humble sacrifice to the cross, which is revolting
to unbelievers, but to us is salvation and eternal life. Where is
your philosopher? Your reasoner? Where is the boasting of the
so-called intelligent? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For our God Jesus Christ was conceived
by Mary, by divine dispensation, of the line of David and of the
holy Spirit; he was born and he was baptized so that by his suffering
he might purify the water.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">19 </b>And the maidenhood of Mary was hidden from the ruler of
this world, as were her giving birth and likewise the death of the
Lord—three secrets to be cried aloud, which yet were accomplished
in the silence of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>How, then, was he shown to the
ages? A star blazed forth in heaven brighter than all the stars,
and its light was inexpressible, and its strangeness caused astonishment,
and all the rest of the stars, along with the sun and
moon, formed a chorus round the star, but it outshone them all;
and there was perplexity as to where this strange thing, so unlike
the rest, came from. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>In consequence of it all magic was dissolved,
and every wicked spell vanished, ignorance was abolished, the
old kingdom was destroyed, when God appeared in human form,
to bring us new, eternal life; and what God had prepared had
<span class="pb" id="page_213"><b class="pb">{Page 213}</b></span>
its beginning. Hence all things were in confusion, because the
abolishing of death was being designed.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">20 </b>If Jesus Christ permits you through your prayer, and it is God’s
will, in the second letter which I mean to write you, I will explain
to you further the divine plan I have touched upon, as to the
new man Jesus Christ, in his faith and in his love, in his suffering
and resurrection; <sup class="verse">2 </sup>especially if the Lord reveals to me that you
all individually every one come together in grace, in one faith and
in Jesus Christ, who was physically descended from David, the
Son of man and Son of God, so that you may obey the bishop
and the elders with an undisturbed mind, breaking one bread,
which is the medicine of immortality, the antidote against death,
to make us live forever in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">21 </b>My life is given for you and for those whom to do God honour
you sent to Smyrna, from which place I am writing to you, with
thanksgiving to the Lord and love for Polycarp as well as for
you. Remember me, as Jesus Christ remembers you. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Pray for the
church in Syria, from which I am being led bound to Rome,
though I am the last of the believers there, as I have been thought
worthy to do honour to God. Farewell in union with God the
Father and Jesus Christ our common hope.</p>

<h3>To the Magnesians</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to her that is blessed with
the favour of God the Father, through Jesus Christ our
Saviour, in whom I greet the church that is at Magnesia on
the Maeander, and wish her heartiest greeting in God the
Father and in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>When I learned how well disciplined you are in godly love, I
rejoiced and resolved in faith in Jesus Christ to address you. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For
having been thought worthy of a most revered title, in the chains
that I wear I sing the praises of the churches, in which I pray that
<span class="pb" id="page_214"><b class="pb">{Page 214}</b></span>
there may be union of the flesh and spirit of Jesus Christ, our
everlasting life, and of faith and love, than which nothing is better,
and above all of Jesus and the Father. In union with him, if
we endure the ill-treatment of the evil genius of this world, and
escape, we will reach God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>Since therefore I have been permitted to see you in the persons
of Damas your godly bishop and your worthy elders Bassus and
Apollonius, and your deacon Zotion, my fellow slave, whose
friendship may I enjoy, because he obeys the bishop as the grace
of God and the board of elders as the law of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>But it is right for you not to take advantage of the youth of the
bishop but in view of the power of God the Father to show him
all reverence, as I know the holy elders do, taking no advantage
of his youthful appearance, but like men of godly prudence deferring
to him, yet not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ,
to the bishop of all. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>In honour therefore of him who loved us it is
right to be obedient without any hypocrisy. For it is not that a
man deceives this bishop who can be seen, but that he tries to
defraud the one who is invisible. In such a case one has to reckon
not with flesh and blood, but with God who knows what is
secret.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>It is right, therefore, not just to be called Christians, but also
to be such, just as some call a man bishop, but do everything
without regard to him. Such men do not appear to me to be conscientious
because they do not hold authorized meetings in accordance
with the commandment.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Since, therefore, affairs come to an end, two things together lie
before us, life and death, and each one is going to go to his own
place; <sup class="verse">2 </sup>for just as there are two coinages, the one that of God, the
other that of the world, and each has its own stamp on it, the
unbelieving bear the stamp of this world, and those who believe
with love bear the stamp of God the Father through Jesus Christ,
through whom, unless we choose to die in his suffering, his life is
not in us.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_215"><b class="pb">{Page 215}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>Since, therefore, in the persons I have mentioned I have seen
in faith and have loved your whole number, I exhort you, be
zealous to do everything in godly harmony, with the bishop presiding
in the place of God, and the elders in the place of the
council of the apostles, and the deacons too, who are so dear to
me, entrusted with the service of Jesus Christ, who from eternity
was with the Father and finally appeared. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>You must all therefore
assume God’s attitude and respect one another, and let no one
regard his neighbour materially, but in union with Jesus Christ, always
love one another. Let there be nothing among you that will
be able to divide you, but be at one with the bishop and with the
leaders, for an example and lesson of immortality.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>So just as the Lord did nothing without the Father, since he
was united with him, either by himself or through the apostles,
you must do nothing without the bishop and the elders. Do not
try to make anything appear right for you by yourselves, but let
there be one prayer in common, one petition, one mind, one hope
in love, in faultless joy, which is Jesus Christ, than whom there is
nothing better. Hasten all of you to come together as to one temple
of God, as to one altar, to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from
one Father and is in one and has gone to one.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>Do not be led astray by strange doctrines or old fables, since
they are profitless. For if we are still practising Judaism, we
admit that we have not received God’s favour. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the most divine
prophets lived in accordance with Jesus Christ. That is why they
were also persecuted, being inspired by his grace, that the disobedient
might be convinced that there is one God, who has
manifested himself through Jesus Christ his Son, who is his Word
that proceeded from silence, who in all things was pleasing to
him that sent him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>If, then, those who lived in ancient ways attained a new hope,
no longer keeping the sabbath but observing the Lord’s Day, on
which our life too rose through him and his death (which some
deny)—a mystery through which we came to believe, and because
<span class="pb" id="page_216"><b class="pb">{Page 216}</b></span>
of this we endure, so that we may be found disciples of
Jesus Christ, our only teacher, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>how shall we be able to live without
him to whom even the prophets, being his disciples in the
spirit, looked forward as their teacher? And therefore he whom
they waited for in uprightness, when he came raised them from
the dead.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Let us not therefore be insensible of his kindness. For if he
imitates us in what we do, we are lost. Let us therefore, since we
have become his disciples, learn to live our Christianity. For whoever
is called by any other name than this does not belong to
God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So lay aside the bad yeast that has grown stale and sour, and
change to the new yeast, which is Jesus Christ. Be salted with
him, so that no one of you may be spoiled, for you will be convicted
by the smell. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>It is wrong to talk of Jesus Christ and live
like the Jews. For Christianity did not believe in Judaism but
Judaism in Christianity, in which every language believed and
was brought together to God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>This I say, my dear friends, not because I know that any of you
are doing it, but as less than you, I want you to be on your guard
against falling into the snares of vainglory but be convinced of
the birth and suffering and resurrection which took place in the
time of the govenorship of Pontius Pilate, which were truly and
certainly brought about by Jesus Christ our hope, from which
may none of you be turned aside.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>May I have joy of you in every way, if I am worthy. For though
I am in chains, I cannot compare with one of you who are at
liberty. I know that you are not conceited, for you have Jesus
Christ within you. And all the more, when I commend you, I
know you that you feel ashamed, for the scripture says, “The upright
is his own accuser.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>Be zealous, therefore, to be firmly grounded in the edicts of
the Lord and the apostles in order that in everything you do you
may prosper in flesh and spirit, through faith and love, in the
Son and the Father and the Spirit, in the beginning and at the
end, along with your most esteemed bishop and the worthily
<span class="pb" id="page_217"><b class="pb">{Page 217}</b></span>
woven spiritual wreath of your board of elders, and the godly
deacons. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Subordinate yourselves to the bishop and to one another,
as Jesus Christ in the flesh did to the Father, and the apostles did
to the Father and to Christ and the Spirit, so that there may be
union of both flesh and spirit.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>Since I know that you are full of God, I have exhorted you
briefly. Remember me in your prayers, so that I may reach the
presence of God, and remember the church in Syria, to which I
am not worthy to belong. For I need your united prayer in God
and your love, that the church in Syria may be deemed worthy
of being bedewed by your church.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>From Smyrna, from which place I am writing to you, the
Ephesians greet you; being here for the glory of God, like yourselves;
they have rested me, along with Polycarp, bishop of
Smyrna. The rest of the churches also greet you in honour of
Jesus Christ. Farewell in God’s harmony, possessed of an,
undivided spirit, which is Jesus, Christ.</p>

<h3>To the Trallians</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to her that is beloved of God,
the Father of Jesus Christ, the holy church that is in Tralles in
Asia, chosen and worthy, outwardly and inwardly at peace
through the suffering of Jesus Christ, who is our hope through
our resurrection unto him; which church I greet in the full experience
of God, in the apostolic fashion, and offer her heartiest
greeting.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>I have learned that you have a disposition that is faultless and
unwavering in endurance, not from habit but by nature, as Polybius
your bishop has shown me, who by the will of God and
Jesus Christ has come to me at Smyrna, and so rejoiced with me,
in chains as I am in Christ Jesus, that I beheld in him your whole
company. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So having received through him your godly kindness I
gave God glory, that I had found that you were imitators of God,
as I had heard.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_218"><b class="pb">{Page 218}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>For when you subordinate yourselves to the bishop as to Jesus
Christ you appear to me to be living not in the human way, but
after the manner of Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order that
by believing in his death you might escape death. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>It is necessary,
therefore, as indeed you do, that you do nothing without the
bishop, but subordinate yourselves also to the board of elders as
to the apostles of Jesus Christ our hope, in union with whom we
shall be found, if we so live. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And the deacons too, as ministers of
the mysteries of Jesus Christ, must please all in every way. For
they are not servers of food and drink, but servants of the church
of God. So they must be on their guard against accusations as
against fire.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>In the same way all must respect the deacons as Jesus Christ,
as they do the bishop also for he symbolizes the Father, and
the elders as a council of God and a band of apostles. Without
these no body can be called a church. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>With all this I am sure
that you agree. For I have received and still have with me in the
person of your bishop a sample of your love. His very demeanour
is a great lesson and his gentleness is power; I think even the unbelievers
revere him. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Because I love you, I spare you, though I
might write more sharply on his behalf. But I do not think myself
entitled, condemned as I am, to command you like an apostle.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Through union with God I have many ideas, but I take my own
measure, so that I may not perish through boasting. For now I
must more than ever be afraid and not pay attention to those who
flatter me. For those who talk to me scourge me. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For I am glad
to suffer, but I do not know whether I am worthy. For the jealousy
is not apparent to many, but it makes war on me all the
more. So I need humility, by which the ruler of this world can
be destroyed.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things? But I am
afraid that I may do you harm, for you are babies. So pardon
me, or you may be choked, through being unable to take them in.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>For I myself, though I am in chains and can understand heavenly
<span class="pb" id="page_219"><b class="pb">{Page 219}</b></span>
things and the assignments of the angels and the relations of their
rulers, and things seen and unseen, for all that am not yet a
disciple. For we lack many things, that we may not come short
of God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>I entreat you therefore—yet not I but the love of Jesus Christ—use
only Christian food and abstain from the herbage of others
which is heresy. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For they mix Jesus Christ with themselves, while
imposing on people with their pretensions of honesty, just as
though they might give a deadly drug with honeyed wine, in
ignorance of which a man gladly accepts death with fatal
pleasure.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>So be on your guard against such men. And you will be, if you
are not conceited but are inseparable from the God of Jesus
Christ, and the bishop and the commands of the apostles. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>He who
is inside the altar is clean; but he who is outside the altar is not
clean; that is to say, he who does anything without bishop and
board of elders and deacon has not a clear conscience.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>Not that I know of any such thing among you, but I am keeping
watch over you, since you are dear to me, for I foresee the
snares of the devil. So take on meekness, and renew yourselves
in faith, which is the Lord’s flesh, and in love, which is the blood
of Jesus Christ. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Let no one of you hold a grudge against his
neighbour. Give the heathen no grounds for finding fault, so
that the godly majority may not be abused on account of a foolish
few. For alas for him through whom my name is foolishly
abused among any.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>Stop your ears, therefore, when anyone speaks to you apart
from Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, who was the
son of Mary, who was truly born, who both ate and drank, was
truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate, was truly crucified and
died, in the sight of those in heaven and on earth and under the
earth; <sup class="verse">2 </sup>who was also truly raised from the dead, when his Father
raised him, and his Father in like manner will raise us also who
believe in him, through Christ Jesus, without whom we can have
no true life.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_220"><b class="pb">{Page 220}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>But if, as some say, who are without God, that is, unbelievers,
that he suffered only in semblance, though they are themselves
only semblance, why am I in chains, and why do I pray to fight
wild beasts? Then I am dying in vain. In that case I am speaking
falsely of the Lord.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>So flee from such evil offshoots, which bear a deadly fruit,
and if a man tastes of it he immediately dies. For these are not
a planting of the Father. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if they were, they would be seen to
be branches of the cross, and their fruit eternal—the cross by
which through his suffering he calls you, since you are parts of
him. Therefore the head cannot be born without the parts of the
body, since God promises union, which is himself.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>I send you greetings from Smyrna, as do the churches of God
that are with me, who have rested me in body and spirit. My
chains exhort you, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>which I carry around with me for the sake of
Jesus Christ, praying that I may reach the presence of God;
continue to be harmonious and to pray with one another. For it
is right that every one of you, and particularly the elders, should
cheer the bishop, in honour of the Father and of Jesus Christ and
of the apostles. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I pray that you may listen to me in love, so that
I may not by having written become evidence against you. But
pray for me too, for I need your love, by the mercy of God, so
that I may be found worthy to obtain the lot which it is incumbent
upon me to obtain, so that I may not be disqualified.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>The love of the Smyrnaeans and Ephesians greets you. Remember
in your prayers the church in Syria, in which I am not
worthy to be counted, for I am the last of them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Farewell in Jesus
Christ, and subordinate yourselves to the bishop as God’s command,
and to the board of elders in the same way. Love one another
every one of you with undivided heart. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>My spirit offers
itself for you not only now, but also when I shall reach the presence
of God. For I am still in danger, but through Jesus Christ
the Father can be counted on to answer my prayer and yours.
May you be found faultless in union with him.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_221"><b class="pb">{Page 221}</b></span></p>

<h3>To the Romans</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to her who has found mercy
through the majesty of the Father Most High, and of Jesus Christ
his only Son—to the church by the will of him who has willed
all things that are, beloved and enlightened in faith and in love
of Jesus Christ our God, which holds the chief place in the seat
of the country of Rome, worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy
of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthily pure,
and pre-eminent in love, named after Christ, named after the
Father, which I greet in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the
Father; you who are united in body and spirit to every one of
his commandments, unwaveringly filled with the grace of God,
and strained clear of every alien colour, hearty greetings free
from blame in Jesus Christ our God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Since in answer to my prayer to God I have been permitted
to see your godly faces, so that I have received even more than
I asked—for I hope to greet you in chains for Christ Jesus, if it
proves to be God’s will that I should be found worthy to the end.
For the beginning has been well arranged, if only I can find
favour to obtain my inheritance unhindered. For I am afraid your
very love will do me wrong, for it is easy for you to do what you
please, but it is hard for me to reach the presence of God, if
you do not let me alone.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>For I do not want you to please men, but please God, just as
you are doing. For I shall never have such an opportunity to reach
the presence of God, nor can you, if you will be silent, put your
names to a better deed. For if you are silent and let me alone, I
shall be a word of God; but if you are in love with my body, I
shall be just a voice again. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Grant me nothing more than to be
poured out in sacrifice to God, while there is still an altar ready,
so that you may form a chorus in love and sing to the Father
through Jesus Christ, because God has deemed the bishop of
Syria worthy to be found at the setting of the sun, summoning
<span class="pb" id="page_222"><b class="pb">{Page 222}</b></span>
him from the sunrise. It is good to set from the world unto God,
so that I may rise to him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>You have never envied anyone, you have taught others. And
I want those things that you teach when instructing others to
hold good. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Only pray that I may have inward and outward
strength, so that I may not only say so but really desire it, that I
may not only be called a Christian but be found to be one. For
if I am found to be one, I can also be called one, and be faithful
when I am no longer visible to the world. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Nothing visible is good.
For our God Jesus Christ is more plainly visible now that he is
in the Father. Christianity is not a matter of persuasion, but is
greatest when it is hated by the world.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>I am writing to all the churches and I charge all that I willingly
die for God, if only you do not prevent it. I entreat you, do not
be an ill-timed kindness to me. Let me be eaten by the wild
beasts, through whom I can reach the presence of God. I am God’s
wheat, and I am ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, so that
I may be found pure bread of Christ. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Instead, coax the wild
beasts to be my grave, and to leave none of my body, so that
when I have fallen asleep I may not be burdensome to anyone.
Then I shall really be a disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world
will not see even my body. Pray to Christ for me, that through
these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I do not
command you, like Peter and Paul. They were apostles, I am a
condemned man. They were free, I am still a slave. But if I suffer,
I shall be emancipated by Jesus Christ, and I will rise in
him, free. And now in chains I am learning to have no desires.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>From Syria to Rome, I am fighting with wild beasts, on land
and sea, night and day, bound to ten leopards, that is, a squad
of soldiers, who get worse the better they are treated. Through
their ill-treatment I am being made more and more a disciple,
but that does not prove that I am innocent. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>May I enjoy the
wild beasts that are prepared for me, and I pray I may find them
quick. I will coax them to devour me quickly, not as in the case of
<span class="pb" id="page_223"><b class="pb">{Page 223}</b></span>
some whom they were afraid to touch. If they will not of their
own accord, I will force them to. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Pardon me, I know what is
best for me. I am just beginning to be a disciple. May nothing,
visible or invisible, envy my reaching the presence of Jesus Christ.
Fire and cross and struggles with wild beasts, crushing of bones,
mangling of limbs; grinding of my whole body, wicked torments
of the devil—let them come upon me, only let me reach the
presence of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>The ends of the earth and the kingdoms of this world will do
me no good. It is better for me to die in Jesus Christ than to be
king of the ends of the earth. I am in search of him who died for
us. I want him who rose for our sake. Childbirth is upon me. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Excuse
me, brethren. Do not hinder my coming to life, do not wish
me to die. Do not give to the world the man who wants to belong
to God, nor delude him with mere matter. Let me receive the
clear light. When I reach it, I shall be a man indeed. Let me be
an imitator of the suffering of my God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>If anyone has him within
himself, let him understand what I want, and share my feeling,
knowing what compels me.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>The ruler of this world wants to take me captive and destroy
my purpose toward God. So let none of you who are present help
him. Take my side, that is, God’s, instead. Do not talk Jesus
Christ, and desire the world. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Envy must not live among you.
Even if when I come I beseech you, do not obey me, but obey
this that I am writing to you, instead. For I write you alive, yet
in love with death. My love has been crucified, and there is no
material passion in me, but living water, speaking within me,
saying to me from within, “Come to the Father.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I do not enjoy
perishable food or the pleasures of this life. I want the bread of
God, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, who was descended from
David, and for drink I want his blood, which is immortal love.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>I no longer want to live a human life. And this can happen, if
you want it to. Want it, so that you too may be wanted. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I am
asking you for it with a short letter; believe me! Jesus Christ will
<span class="pb" id="page_224"><b class="pb">{Page 224}</b></span>
show you that I am telling the truth when I say this. He is the
unerring mouth by which the Father has spoken truly. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Pray for
me, that I may attain this. I write you not in terms of flesh and
blood but of the mind of God. If I suffer, you favoured me; if
I am rejected, you hated me.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>Remember in your prayers the church in Syria, which has God
for its pastor in my place. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it,
together with your love. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I am ashamed to be called one of them,
for I do not deserve it, for I am the last of them and born at the
wrong time, but if I reach the presence of God I have obtained
mercy to be somebody. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>My spirit sends you greeting, and so does
the love of the churches that have welcomed me in the name of
Jesus Christ not as a mere passer-by. For those that were not
actually on my way escorted me from city to city.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>I write you this from Smyrna, by the hands of the deservedly
happy Ephesians. I have with me also, besides many others,
Crocus, a person dear to me. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>About those who have gone ahead
of me from Syria to Rome for the glory of God, I believe you
have had news; let them know that I am near. For they are all
worthy of God and of you, and it is right for you to refresh them
in every way. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I write you this on the ninth day before the kalends
of September [August 24]. Farewell to the end, in the endurance
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>To the Philadelphians</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to the church of God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ that is at Philadelphia in Asia,
that has found mercy and been established in godly harmony and
unwaveringly rejoices in the suffering of our Lord and in his
resurrection, being fully assured in all mercy; in the blood of
Jesus Christ I send greeting to her who is eternal and abiding joy,
especially if they be at one with the bishop and the elders and
deacons who are with him, appointed with the approval of
<span class="pb" id="page_225"><b class="pb">{Page 225}</b></span>
Jesus Christ, whom he has securely established in accordance
with his will by his holy Spirit.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>This bishop I know obtained his ministry, which is for the common
good, not of himself or through men, nor through vanity,
but in love of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I am
amazed at his forbearance; he can do more by keeping silence
than those who utter empty words. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For he is tuned to the commandments
as a harp is tuned to its strings. For that reason my
soul blesses his attitude to God, recognizing it as virtuous and
perfect, his steadfast and patient spirit too, with all the forbearance
of the living God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>So as children of the light of truth, flee from division and false
teachings; follow like sheep where the pastor is. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For many plausible
wolves take the runners in God’s race captive with wicked
pleasures, but in your unity they will find no place.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>Keep away from evil pastures which Jesus Christ does not tend,
for they are no planting of the Father. Not that I found any
division among you, but a filtering process. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For all who belong
to God and Jesus Christ are with the bishop, and all who repent
and return to unity with the church will also belong to God, in
order to live in harmony with Jesus Christ. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Do not be misled, my
brethren. If anyone follows a schismatic, he cannot inherit the
kingdom of God; if anyone holds alien views, he does not support
Christ’s suffering.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Be zealous, therefore, to practise one giving of thanks, for
there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup in token
of union in his blood, one altar, as well as one bishop with the
board of elders and the deacons, my fellow slaves, in order that
whatever you do you do in accordance with the will of God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>My brethren, I am altogether overflowing in love for you, and
in the height of my exultation I am safeguarding you, yet not I,
but Jesus Christ. Being in chains for him I am all the more afraid,
as being still imperfect. But your prayer to God will perfect me,
so that I may attain what I have been mercifully allotted, having
<span class="pb" id="page_226"><b class="pb">{Page 226}</b></span>
taken refuge in the gospel as the flesh and blood of Jesus, and
in the apostles as the board of elders of the church. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And we love
the prophets too, because they too announced the gospel, and
hoped in him and awaited him, through believing in whom they
were saved, being united with Jesus Christ—holy men worthy of
love and admiration, borne witness to by Jesus Christ, and numbered
with us in preaching the good news of our common hope.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>But if anyone expounds Judaism to you, do not listen to him.
For it is better to hear Christianity from a man who is circumcised
than Judaism from one who is uncircumcised. But if both
do not talk of Jesus Christ, they are to me tombstones and graves
of the dead, on which only men’s names are written. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Flee, therefore,
from the frauds and traps of the ruler of this world, in order
that you may not be distressed by his designs and weaken in your
love, but get together, all of you, with undivided heart. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I thank
my God that I have a clear conscience about you, and no one
can boast in private or in public that I have been a burden to anyone
in anything, great or small. And for all among whom I have
spoken, I pray that they may not find it a testimony against
themselves.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>For even though some desired to lead me astray according to
the flesh, yet the spirit is not misled, for it is from God. For it
knows where it comes from and where it is going, and it exposes
secret things. I cried out when I was among you, I spoke with a
loud voice, the voice of God, Pay attention to the bishop and
the board of elders and the deacons. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Some suspected me of saying
this because I knew beforehand that some had created division.
But he for whom I am in chains is my witness that I knew this
from no human flesh and blood. It was the spirit that was preaching,
saying this: Do nothing without the bishop, keep your body
as the temple of God, love unity, avoid divisions, be imitators of
Jesus Christ as he was of his Father.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>I therefore did my part as a man devoted to unity. But where
division and anger exist, God does not dwell. Now the Lord forgives
<span class="pb" id="page_227"><b class="pb">{Page 227}</b></span>
all who repent, if in repentance they turn to union with God
and the council of the bishop. I have faith in the grace of Jesus
Christ, who will free you from every chain. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I beg you to do nothing
from party spirit, but follow Christ’s teaching. For I have
heard some say, “What I cannot find in the records, I will not
believe in the gospel.” And when I said to them, “It is scripture,”
they answered me, “That is the question!” But my records are
Jesus Christ, the incontestable records are his cross and death
and his resurrection and faith through him; by these I want to be
made upright through your prayers.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>The priests too were admirable, but the high priest is greater,
who has been intrusted with what is most holy, who alone has
been intrusted with the secrets of God, for he is himself the door
to the Father, through which Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and
the prophets and the apostles and the church enter. All these
things contribute to union with God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But the gospel possesses
something distinctive in the coming of the Saviour, our Lord Jesus
Christ, his suffering and resurrection. For the beloved prophets
in their preaching looked to him, but the gospel is the consummation
of immortality. All these together are good, if you have faith
with love.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Since through your prayers and the affection you have through
union with Christ Jesus, word has reached me that the church
at Antioch in Syria is at peace, it is right for you as a church of
God to appoint a deacon to go there as an ambassador of God to
congratulate them when they are gathered together, and to glorify
the Name. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Blessed in Jesus Christ be he who shall be found
worthy of such a service; you too will be glorified. It is not impossible
for you to do this for the sake of God, if you choose to, just
as the neighbouring churches have done, sending bishops, and
others elders and deacons.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>As to Philo, the deacon from Cilicia, a man of good repute,
who is still serving me in preaching the word of God, along with
Rhaeus Agathopus, a choice man, who has accompanied me from
<span class="pb" id="page_228"><b class="pb">{Page 228}</b></span>
Syria, bidding his life goodbye, they bear you witness, and I
thank God for you, because you welcomed them, as the Lord
has welcomed you. But may those who showed them disrespect
be redeemed by the favour of Jesus Christ. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The love of the
brethren at Troas sends you greeting. From there I am writing
to you, by the hand of Burrhus who was sent with me by the
Ephesians and Smyrnaeans, to do me honour. Jesus Christ, in
whom they hope in body, soul and spirit, in faith, love and
harmony, will honour them. Farewell in union with Jesus
Christ, our common hope.</p>

<h3>To the Smyrnaeans</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to the church of God the
Father and the beloved Jesus Christ, which has found mercy with
every spiritual gift, filled with faith and love, which is lacking
in no spiritual gift, most revered and bearing the sacred vessels,
that is at Smyrna in Asia, heartiest greetings in a blameless spirit
and in the word of God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>I extol Jesus Christ, the God who has given you such wisdom.
For I have observed that you are fixed in unshakable faith, as
though you were nailed in body and spirit to the cross of the
Lord Jesus Christ, and established in love by the blood of Christ,
convinced about our Lord that he was in truth physically of the
line of David, Son of God by the will and power of God, truly
born of a virgin, baptized by John so that all uprightness might
be fulfilled by him; <sup class="verse">2 </sup>truly nailed for us in body under Pontius
Pilate and Herod the governor, from the fruit of which we are,
from his most blessed suffering, that he might through his resurrection
raise a standard for the ages for his holy and faithful
people, whether among Jews or among heathen, in the one body
of his church.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>For he suffered all these things for our sakes, in order that we
might be saved. And he suffered really, just as he also really
raised himself; it is not as some unbelievers say that he suffered
seemingly, who themselves exist only seemingly, and as their
<span class="pb" id="page_229"><b class="pb">{Page 229}</b></span>
opinion is, will be their experience, for they will be disembodied
and demon-possessed.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>For I know and believe that even after the resurrection he
was in the flesh. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And when he came to those who were with Peter,
he said to them, “Take me and feel of me, and see that I am no
incorporeal phantom.” And they immediately touched him and
believed, being blended with his flesh and spirit. That is why
they despised death, and showed themselves superior to death.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>And after the resurrection he ate and drank with them, as a being
of flesh and blood, though spiritually united with the Father.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>But I give you these warnings, dear friends, though I know
you agree with me. But I am guarding you in advance against
wild beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only refuse
to welcome but if possible even to meet, only you must pray for
them, if somehow, difficult as it is, they may repent. Yet Jesus
Christ, our true life, has power to bring it about. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For if these
things were done by our Lord only seemingly, I am only seemingly
in chains. And why did I give myself up to death, to face
fire, sword, and wild beasts? But near the sword is near to God,
in the midst of the wild beasts is in the midst of God, if only it
is done for the sake of Jesus Christ. In order to suffer with him
I can endure it all, since he who became perfect man gives me
strength.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Some ignorantly deny him, or rather have been denied by him,
for they are advocates of death rather than of truth. They have
not been convinced by the prophecies or the law of Moses, or as
yet by the gospel, or our individual sufferings. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For they have the
same idea about us. For what good does anyone do me, if he
praises me, but reviles my Lord by not admitting that he wore
flesh and blood? Whoever does not say this has completely denied
him, for he is a mere corpse bearer. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Their names, since they are
unbelievers, I have decided not to write down, but may I not
even remember them until they repent about Christ’s suffering,
which is our resurrection.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>Let no one be deceived. Even the heavenly beings and the glory
<span class="pb" id="page_230"><b class="pb">{Page 230}</b></span>
of the angels and the rulers visible and invisible if they do not
believe in the blood of Christ will incur judgment. Let him accept
it who can. No one must be exalted by position, for faith and love
are everything, and there is nothing superior to them. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Observe
how contrary to the mind of God they are who teach strange
ideas about the favour of Jesus Christ that has come to us. They
care nothing for love, for the widow, for the orphan, for the
oppressed, for him who is in prison, or him who is released, for
the hungry or the thirsty.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>They keep away from Thanksgiving and prayer, because they
do not admit that the Thanksgiving is the flesh of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father
in his kindness raised up. So those who contradict the gift of God
perish in their disputing. It would be better for them to love, in
order to rise. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So it is right to keep away from such men, and not
speak of them either in private or in public, but to pay attention
to the prophets and especially to the gospel, in which the Lord’s
suffering has been shown us and the resurrection has been
effected. Avoid divisions as the beginning of evils.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>You must all follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the
Father, and you must follow the board of elders as you would
the apostles, and revere the deacons as the command of God.
Let no one do any of the things that have to do with the church,
without the bishop. Let that be considered a valid Thanksgiving
which is held under the bishop or someone authorized by him.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>Wherever the bishop appears, let the people be, just as wherever
Jesus Christ is, there is the universal church. It is not permissible
to baptize or hold a religious meal without the bishop, but whatever
he approves is also pleasing to God, so that everything you
do may be secure and valid.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>Finally, it is reasonable for us to come to our senses while
we still have time to repent and turn to God. It is well to recognize
God and the bishop. Whoever honours the bishop is honoured
by God. Whoever does anything without the bishop’s
<span class="pb" id="page_231"><b class="pb">{Page 231}</b></span>
knowledge is serving the devil. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So may everything abound to
you through grace, for you deserve it. You have rested me in
every way, and may Jesus Christ rest you. You have loved me
when I was absent and when I was present. God reward you!
If you endure everything for his sake, you will reach his
presence.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>Philo and Rhaeus Agathopus, who accompanied me for God’s
sake, you did well to welcome as deacons of Christ God. They
too thank the Lord for you, because you rested them in every
way. You will certainly not lose anything! <sup class="verse">2 </sup>My spirit is given for
you, and so are my chains which you did not despise or feel
ashamed of. And Jesus Christ, our perfect hope, will not be
ashamed of you.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>Your prayer has gone to the church at Antioch in Syria. From
there I come bound with most revered chains, and I send greetings
to all, though I am not worthy to be from there, for I am
the last among them. But by the will of God I have been thought
worthy not from any conscious act, but by the favour of God,
which I pray may be given me in full measure, in order that by
your prayers I may reach the presence of God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So in order that
you work may be completed, both on earth and in heaven, it is
right that in God’s honour your church appoint an ambassador of
God to go to Syria and congratulate them because they are at
peace, and have regained their proper size and recovered their
proper proportions. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So it seemed to me an act worthy of God for
you to send one of your own number with a letter to join in
glorifying the calm which by God’s will has come to them, and
because they have now found a haven through your prayer. As
you are perfect, aim at what is perfect. For if you want to do
well, God is ready to help you.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>The love of the brethren at Troas sends you greetings. From
there I am writing to you by the hand of Burrhus, whom you in
co-operation with your brethren the Ephesians sent with me,
and he has rested me in every way. I wish that all imitated him,
for he is a model of the ministry of God. Grace will fully repay
<span class="pb" id="page_232"><b class="pb">{Page 232}</b></span>
him. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I send greetings to the godly bishop, and the revered
board of elders, and my fellow slaves the deacons, and to you all
individually and collectively, in the name of Jesus Christ and in
his flesh and blood, in his suffering and resurrection, both physical
and spiritual, in union with God and with you. Grace,
mercy, peace, endurance be with you always.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>I send greetings to the families of my brethren, with their
wives and children, and to the unmarried women who are called
widows. Goodbye in the Father’s power! Philo who is with me
sends you greetings. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I send greetings to the household of Tavia,
and pray that she may be made steadfast in faith and love, in both
body and spirit. I send greetings to Alce, one very dear to me,
and to the incomparable Daphnus, and Eutecnus and each and
all by name. Goodbye in the grace of God.</p>

<h3>To Polycarp</h3>

<p>Ignatius, also called Theophorus, to Polycarp, bishop of the
church of the Smyrnaeans, or rather who has for his bishop God
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, heartiest greetings.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>I am so much pleased with your godly attitude, based as it
is as though on immovable rock, that I glory exceedingly in
having been permitted to see your blameless face; may I have joy
from it in God! <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I urge you, by the grace with which you are
clothed, to press on in your race, and to urge all men to be saved.
Justify your position, with all diligence of body and spirit. Pay
attention to unity, for there is nothing better. Lift all men up, as
the Lord lifts you up; bear with all men in love, just as you are
doing. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Devote yourself to unceasing prayers. Ask for more understanding
than you have. Be watchful, keeping your spirit awake.
Speak to each individual, in God’s way. Carry the sicknesses of
all men, like a perfect athlete. Where there is more toil, there is
much gain.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>If you love good disciples, it is no credit to you; rather induce
<span class="pb" id="page_233"><b class="pb">{Page 233}</b></span>
the more troublesome to subjection by your gentleness. Not every
wound is healed by the same plaster. Relieve paroxysms with
moist applications. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Be wise like a serpent in all things and
always guileless like a dove. This is why you are made of flesh
and spirit—so that you may humour what is visible before your
face; but ask that what is unseen may be shown you, so that you
may lack nothing and abound in every gift. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The time demands
you, as pilots demand winds and a storm-tossed man a harbour,
in order to reach the presence of God. Be sober as God’s athlete;
the prize is immortality and eternal life, of which you also are
persuaded. All in all, I am given for you, and so are my chains,
which you have loved.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>Men who seem plausible but teach strange doctrines must not
appal you. Stand firm like an anvil that is hammered. It
behoves a great athlete to stand blows and yet win. Most of all,
for God’s sake we must endure anything, so that he too may
endure us. Be more zealous than you are. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Understand the times.
Wait for him who is above time, timeless, invisible, yet visible
for our sakes, impalpable, incapable of suffering, yet he suffered
for us; who in every way endured for our sakes.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Widows must not be neglected. After the Lord, you must be
their protector. Nothing must be done without your approval, and
you must not do anything without God, as indeed you do not.
Stand firm. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Hold more frequent meetings. Seek all out by name.
Do not look down on men or women slaves, but they themselves
must not be conceited, but be better slaves to the glory of God,
in order that they may obtain from God a better freedom. They
must not be in love with being freed at the cost of the church,
or they may prove slaves of passion.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Flee from frauds, or rather preach about them. Tell my sisters
to love the Lord and be contented with their husbands in body
and spirit. In the same way charge my brethren also in the name
of Jesus Christ to love their wives as the Lord loves the church.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>If anyone is able to maintain chastity to the honour of the flesh
<span class="pb" id="page_234"><b class="pb">{Page 234}</b></span>
of the Lord, let him maintain it without boasting. If he boasts
of it, he is lost, and if anyone besides the bishop knows it, he is
ruined. It is right for men and women who are marrying to form
their union with the approval of the bishop, in order that their
marriage may be in accordance with the Lord’s will and not to
gratify desire. Let it all be done to the honour of God.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>Pay attention to the bishop, in order that God may pay attention
to you. I am giving myself for those who are obedient to
the bishop, the elders, the deacons, and may I have my portion
with them, in God. Toil together, struggle together, race together,
suffer together, rest together, rise together, as God’s managers,
assistants, and servants. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Please him under whom you serve, from
whom you receive you pay; let none of you be found a deserter.
Let your baptism serve as shield, your faith as helmet, your love
as spear, your endurance as full armour. Let your deeds be your
deposits, so that you may get the savings due you. So be patient
with one another in gentleness, as God is with you. Let me have
joy of you always.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>Since the church at Antioch in Syria is at peace, as has been
reported to me, through your prayer, I myself have taken fresh
courage, with God-given freedom from anxiety, if only, through
suffering, I may reach the presence of God, so that at the
resurrection I may be found your disciple. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>It is your duty, most
blessed Polycarp, to call a most holy council and to appoint someone
who is greatly loved and resolute, who can be called God’s
messenger; command him to go to Syria and to glorify your
determined love, to the glory of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>A Christian has no authority
over himself but devotes himself to God. This is God’s work, and
yours also, when you achieve it. For I trust in grace, that you
are ready to do something good in the service of God. I have
exhorted you in a few words, for I know the intensity of your
sincerity.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>So since I cannot write to all the churches, because I am sailing
at once from Troas for Neapolis, as the Will ordains, you
<span class="pb" id="page_235"><b class="pb">{Page 235}</b></span>
must write to the churches ahead, as one who has the mind of
God, to do the same thing, those who can sending messengers,
the rest letters through those you send, so that you may be glorified
by an everlasting deed, as you yourself deserve to be. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I
send greetings to all by name, and to the wife of Epitropus with
all her household and that of her children. I send greetings to my
dear Attalus. I send greetings to the man who is to be directed to
go to Syria. God’s favour will be with him always, and with
Polycarp who sends him. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>I bid you farewell always in our God
Jesus Christ. Abide in him, in the unity and oversight of God. I
send greetings to Aloe, a person beloved by me. Goodbye in the
Lord.</p>

<h2>The Letter of Polycarp to the Philippians</h2>

<p>The letter of Polycarp to the Philippians is an early sequel to the
letters of Ignatius. After Ignatius with his guard left Philippi
for Rome, the Philippian Christians wrote as he had suggested to
Polycarp at Smyrna, asking him to send them such letters of
Ignatius as he had in his possession, and this he did with a covering
letter of instruction and exhortation, which we know as Polycarp
to the Philippians.</p>

<p>Polycarp urges them to be harmonious and steadfast, but does
not stress the threefold ministry, as Ignatius had done, writing
simply in the name of “Polycarp and the elders with him.” He
shows a wider knowledge of Christian literature than Ignatius,
using not only Matthew, Luke-Acts, and the letters of Paul, but
Hebrews and I Peter. He has had no news of the actual fate of
Ignatius, and asks the Philippians if they have received any.
So his letter must have been written a few weeks after Ignatius
wrote the last of his letters at Troas and was taken across the
Aegean to Macedonia.</p>

<p>Recent efforts to divide Polycarp’s letter into two (P.N. Harrison,
<i>Polycarp’s Two Epistles to the Philippians</i>, Cambridge,
1936)—one, chapters 13, 14, a covering letter to accompany the
letters he was forwarding to Philippi, the other, 1-12, a later
letter dealing with a crisis in the Philippian church about A.D. 135
—lose sight of the fact that by that time Polycarp could not fail
to show the influence of the fourfold gospel, published certainly
<span class="pb" id="page_238"><b class="pb">{Page 238}</b></span>
by A.D. 120, and probably in nearby Ephesus. Indeed it is very
likely that Polycarp was active in its publication.</p>

<p>No complete Greek text of Polycarp’s letter has yet been found.
The eight Polycarp-Barnabas manuscripts contain almost nine
chapters, and Eusebius, in the Church History, 3.36.13-15, supplies
chapter 13. For the rest we are dependent upon the Latin
version.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_239"><b class="pb">{Page 239}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Letter of Polycarp to the Philippians</h2>

<p>Polycarp and the elders who are with him to the church of
God that is staying at Philippi, mercy and peace be granted you
in abundance from God the Almighty and Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>I rejoice with you greatly in our Lord Jesus Christ that you welcomed
the copies of true love and as you had opportunity set on
their way the men who were encumbered with saintly chains,
which are the diadems of those truly chosen by God and our
Lord; <sup class="verse">2 </sup>and because the deep root of your faith, which has been
renowned from early times, still lasts and bears fruit to our
Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins endured even facing death,
and whom God raised, setting aside the pains of death; <sup class="verse">3 </sup>on whom,
though you have not seen him, you believe with unutterable,
triumphant joy which many desire to share, for you know that
you have been saved by his favour, not by what you have done,
but by the will of God through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>Therefore prepare for action and serve God in fear and truth,
for you have forsaken fruitless talk and vulgar error, and believed
on him who raised our Lord Jesus from the dead, and gave him
glory and a throne on his right hand; to whom everything in
heaven and on earth is subject, whom everything that has
breath serves, who is to come as judge of the living and the dead,
whose blood God will require from those who disobey him. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>He
who raised him from the dead will raise us also, if we do his will
<span class="pb" id="page_240"><b class="pb">{Page 240}</b></span>
and live by his commands, and love what he loved, refraining
from all injustice, covetousness, love of money, evil-speaking,
false witness; not returning evil for evil or abuse for abuse, or
blow for blow, or curse for curse, <sup class="verse">3 </sup>but remembering what the
Lord said when he taught: “Do not judge, so that you may not
be judged; forgive, and you will be forgiven, have mercy, so that
you may be shown mercy; with the measure you use, men will
measure back to you; and blessed are the poor and those who are
persecuted for their uprightness, for the kingdom of God belongs
to them.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>I write you this, brethren, about uprightness, not taking it
upon myself, but because you first invited me to. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For neither
I nor anyone else like me can follow the wisdom of the blessed
and glorious Paul, who when he was among you, face to face
with the men of that time, carefully and steadfastly uttered his
teaching about truth, and when he was absent wrote you letters,
by poring over which you will be able to build yourselves up in
the faith that has been given to you. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>It is the mother of us all, followed
by hope and led on by love to God and Christ and neighbour.
For if a man is within these he has fulfilled the command
of uprightness, for one who has love is far from any sin.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>Love of money is the beginning of all troubles. So knowing
that we brought nothing into the world, and, can take nothing
out of it either, let us put on the armour of uprightness and teach
ourselves first of all to follow the command of the Lord, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>then
teach your wives to live in the faith that has been given them
and in love and purity, being devoted to their husbands in all
sincerity and loving all alike with perfect chastity, and to bring
up their children in the fear of God. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The widows must be sensible
about the faith of the Lord, and pray constantly for all, refraining
from all slander, evil-speaking, false witness, love of money and
all evil, knowing that they are God’s altar and that all offerings
are examined and none of the thoughts or intentions or secrets
of the heart escapes him.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_241"><b class="pb">{Page 241}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>Knowing, then, that God is not to be sneered at, we ought to
live in a way that is worthy of his command and glory. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Similarly,
deacons must be blameless in the presence of his uprightness as
servants of God and Christ, not of men; not slanderers, straightforward,
not lovers of money, temperate in all things, tenderhearted,
careful, living in accordance with the truth of the Lord,
who became a servant of all. If we please him in this present
world, we will receive the world to come also, even as he
promised us to raise us from the dead, and if we conduct ourselves
in a way worthy of him, we shall also reign with him,
provided we have faith. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Similarly, the younger men must be
blameless in all respects, caring for purity above all, and restraining
themselves from all evil. For it is right to refrain from the passions
in the world, for “every passion is at war with the Spirit,”
and “neither people who are immoral or sensual or given to unnatural
vice will have any share in God’s kingdom,” nor those
who do what is wrong. Therefore it is necessary to refrain from
all these things, subjecting ourselves to the elders and deacons
as to God and Christ. The virgins must live with a blameless and
pure conscience.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>The elders must be tenderhearted, merciful to all, bringing
back what has gone astray, visiting all the sick, neglecting
neither widow nor orphan nor poor man, but always intending
to do what is right in the sight of God and men, refraining from
all anger, partiality, unfair judgment, keeping far from all love
of money, not quick to believe anything against anyone, not
severe in judgment, knowing that we all owe the debt of sin. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>If,
then, we beg the Lord to forgive us, we ought to forgive too, for
we are before the eyes of the Lord and of God, and we must all
stand at the judgment seat of Christ, and each give an account
of himself. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So let us serve him with fear and all concern, just
as he commanded us, and as did the apostles who evangelized
us and the prophets who foretold the coming of our Lord. Let
us be zealous for what is right, refraining from causing offence
<span class="pb" id="page_242"><b class="pb">{Page 242}</b></span>
and from false brothers and from those who bear the name of the
Lord in hypocrisy, and mislead foolish men.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>“For anyone who does not acknowledge that Jesus Christ has
come in the flesh is antichrist,” and whoever does not accept
the testimony of the cross is of the devil, and whoever perverts
the sayings of the Lord to his own desires and says there is neither
resurrection nor judgment—he is the first-born of Satan. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Therefore
let us forsake the folly of the multitude and their false
teachings, and return to the word that was handed down to us
from the beginning, and be collected and prayerful and persevere
in fasting, in our petitions beseeching the all-seeing God
not to subject us to temptation, just as the Lord said, “One’s spirit
is eager, but flesh and blood are weak.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>Let us therefore hold constantly to our hope, and to the
guarantee of our uprightness, that is, Jesus Christ, who carried
the burden of our sins in his own body on the cross, who committed
no sin and deceit was never on his lips, but he endured it
all for us, so that we might live in union with him. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So let us be
imitators of his endurance, and if we suffer for his sake, let us
glorify him. For he set us this example in himself, and this is
what we have believed.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>So I beg you all to obey the message of uprightness and to
exhibit all endurance, such as you saw with your own eyes not
only in the blessed Ignatius and Zosimus and Rufus, but also in
others of your number, and in Paul himself and the rest of the
apostles, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>being assured that all these have not run in vain, but in
faith and uprightness, and that they are in the place that they
have deserved with the Lord, with whom they suffered. For
they did not love the present world, but him who died for us and
was raised up by God for our sakes.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>So stand fast in these things, and follow the Lord’s example,
steadfast in faith and immovable, loving the brotherhood, devoted
to one another, united in truth, giving way to one another in
the gentleness of the Lord, despising nobody. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>When you can do
<span class="pb" id="page_243"><b class="pb">{Page 243}</b></span>
good, do not put it off, for charity delivers from death. You
must all subordinate yourselves to one another, and live irreproachable
lives among the heathen, so that you may be praised
for your good deeds, and the Lord may not be ill spoken of
through you. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But alas for him, on account of whom the name
of the Lord is ill spoken of. Therefore teach all men to be serious,
and be so yourselves.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>I am exceedingly sorry for Valens, who was once made an
elder among you, because he so fails to understand the position
that was given him. I warn you therefore to abstain from
covetousness and to be pure and truthful. Keep yourselves from
all evil. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But how can a man who cannot control himself in these
things preach self-control to someone else? If a man does not
refrain from covetousness, he will be defiled by idolatry and will
be judged as one of the heathen who are ignorant of the judgment
of the Lord. Or do we not know that God’s people are to be
the judges of the world, as Paul teaches? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>But I have not found
or heard of any such thing among you, among whom the blessed
Paul laboured, and who are mentioned in the beginning of a
letter of his. For he boasts of you in all the churches which alone
had then come to know God; we had not yet come to know him.
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Therefore, brethren, I am very sorry for Valens and for his
wife; may the Lord grant them true repentance! So be self-controlled
in this matter, and do not look on such people as
enemies, but call them back as ailing members, gone astray, so
that you may save your whole body. For if you do this, you build
one another up.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>For I am sure that you are well trained in the sacred writings,
and nothing is hidden from you, but this has not been granted
to me. Only, as it says in these scriptures, “Be angry, but do
not sin,” and “the sun must not go down upon your anger.”
Blessed is the man that remembers this, which I believe is the
case with you. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But may the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and the eternal high priest himself, Jesus Christ, the Son
<span class="pb" id="page_244"><b class="pb">{Page 244}</b></span>
of God, build you up in faith and truth, and in all gentleness
and without anger and in patience and long-suffering and endurance
and purity, and may he give you your part and lot with his
saints, and to us with you, and to all who are under heaven
who shall believe in our Lord Jesus Christ and in his Father
who raised him from the dead. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Pray for all the saints. Pray also
for emperors and authorities and rulers, and for those who persecute
you and hate you and for the enemies of the cross, in
order that your fruit may be manifest among all men, so that you
may be perfect in him.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>Both you and Ignatius wrote me that if anyone was going to
Syria he should take your letter also. This I will attend to, if I
find a good opportunity, either myself, or the man I send to represent
you also. The letters of Ignatius that were sent us by him
and the others that we had in our possession we send you as you
instructed us to do; they are appended to this letter, and you will
be able to derive great benefit from them. For they embrace faith,
steadfastness, and all the edification that pertains to our Lord.
And if you learn anything definite about Ignatius himself and
those who are with him, let us know.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>I write you this by Crescens, whom I recommended to you
recently, and recommend now. For he has lived blamelessly
among us, and I believe he will do so among you. But you will
consider his sister recommended when she reaches you. Farewell
in the Lord Jesus Christ in grace with all your people. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_245"><b class="pb">{Page 245}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Martyrdom of Polycarp</h2>

<p>On the 22nd of February, A.D. 156, Polycarp, the venerable and
renowned bishop of Smyrna, suffered martyrdom. He was eighty-six
years old, and had been bishop for fully forty years. He had
only recently returned from a visit to Rome, where he had tried
in vain to reach an agreement with Bishop Anicetus on the
proper date for the celebration of Easter, when he was arrested,
condemned, and brutally put to death.</p>

<p>So great was the dismay and sorrow occasioned by this startling
event that the church at Smyrna recorded it in detail in a
letter, sent to the church at Philomelium, two hundred miles to
the east, and this came to be circulated among the churches generally.
It was a moving story, and marks the virtual beginning of
the great literature of martyrdom, which eventually grew to vast
proportions; the modern editions contain sixty-nine volumes.
Such stories stirred Christians to hold the line in times of persecution.</p>

<p>When Irenaeus was a boy in Asia he had seen Polycarp, and
he tells the story of his spirited encounter with Marcion. Eusebius
copied most of the Martyrdom into his <i>Church History</i>,
4.15, though his text omits some of the few miraculous touches it
contains. There are at least six Greek manuscripts of the Martyrdom,
from the tenth to the thirteenth century, besides a Latin version,
and Syriac and Coptic versions of the Eusebius extracts.
The closing lines of the text throw interesting light upon its
early transmission.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_246"><b class="pb">{Page 246}</b></span></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_247"><b class="pb">{Page 247}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Martyrdom of the Holy Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna</h2>

<p>The church of God that is staying at Smyrna to the church of
God that is staying at Philomelium and to all the congregations
of the holy and catholic church in every place, may the mercy,
peace and love of God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be
granted in abundance.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>We write to you, brethren, the facts about the martyrs and
the blessed Polycarp, who as though setting a seal to it by his
martyrdom brought the persecution to an end. For almost all
the preceding events took place in order that the Lord might
show us again the martyrdom of the Gospel kind. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For like the
Lord he waited to be betrayed, in order that we also might
become his imitators, not taking account of our own interests
only, but of the interests of our neighbours. For it is a mark of
true and constant love to wish that not only one’s self but all
the brethren also be saved.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>Blessed and noble therefore are all the martyrdoms that have
taken place by the will of God. For we must be very careful to
ascribe the power over all things to God. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For who could fail to
admire their nobility and endurance and love for their Master?
For when they were so torn by scourges that their physical structure
was visible even to the inner veins and arteries, they
endured it, so that even the bystanders pitied them and bewailed
them. And others reached such a pitch of heroism that not one
<span class="pb" id="page_248"><b class="pb">{Page 248}</b></span>
of them sighed or groaned, showing all of us that at the very
time they were being tortured the noble martyrs of Christ were
absent from the body, or rather that the Lord stood by them and
talked with them. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And giving heed to the favour of Christ, they
despised the world’s tortures, at the cost of a single hour purchasing
eternal life. And the fire of their inhuman tormentors felt
cold to them, for they kept their eyes on escaping the eternal,
unquenchable fire, and with the eyes of their minds they looked
at the blessings reserved for those who are steadfast, “which no
ear ever heard and no eye ever saw, and never occurred to the
human mind,” but they were shown by the Lord to them, for they
were no longer men but were already angels. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>In like manner those
condemned to the wild beasts endured terrible punishments,
being made to lie on beds of sharp shells, and subjected to other
forms of varied tortures, in order that if he could he might by
persistent punishment bring them to deny their faith.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>For the devil used many devices against them, but, thank
God, he failed against them all. For the most noble Germanicus
reinforced them in their timidity by the endurance he
displayed, and fought gallantly with the wild beasts. For when
the governor wished to persuade him, and told him to have pity
on his youth, he forcibly drew the wild beast upon himself,
wishing to escape the sooner from their unjust and lawless life.
<sup class="verse">2 </sup>So upon that, the whole crowd, amazed at the bravery of the
godly and pious race of Christians, shouted, “Kill the atheists!
Have Polycarp looked for!”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>But one man named Quintus, a Phrygian who had recently
come from Phrygia, when he saw the wild beasts, was frightened.
He was the man who had forced himself and some others to come
forward of their own accord. The governor after much earnest
entreaty prevailed upon this man to take the oath and offer the
sacrifice. That, brethren, is why we do not approve those who
give themselves up, for the gospel does not teach us to do so.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>But the most admirable Polycarp, when he first heard of this,
<span class="pb" id="page_249"><b class="pb">{Page 249}</b></span>
was not alarmed but wanted to stay in the city, but the majority
persuaded him to leave quietly. So he left quietly for a farm not
far from the city, and stayed there with a few others, doing
nothing night or day but pray for all men, and the churches all
over the world, as he was accustomed to do. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And while he was
praying, three days before he was arrested he had a vision, and
saw his pillow ablaze with fire. And he turned and said to those
who were with him, “I must be burned alive.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>As those who were looking for him persisted in their search,
he went over to another farm, and those who were looking for
him came up immediately, and when they failed to find him, they
seized two slave boys, and one of them when he was tortured
confessed. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For it was impossible for him to hide, when those who
betrayed him belonged to his household. And the chief of police,
who happened to have the same name, being called Herod, was
in a hurry to get him to the arena to fulfil his own destiny and
become a sharer with Christ, while those who betrayed him
should incur the punishment of Judas himself.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>So taking the slave along, on Friday, about suppertime, the
police and horsemen set out with their usual arms, as though
after a robber. And late in the evening they came up with him,
and found him in a cottage, in bed in an upstairs room. He could
have got away from there to another place, but he would not,
saying, “God’s will be done.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>So when he heard that they had come, he went down and
talked with them, while the onlookers wondered at his age and
vigour, and why there was such great haste to arrest such an old
man. So he immediately ordered food and drink, as much as they
wanted, set before them, at that hour, and he asked them to give
him an hour to pray without interruption. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>When they agreed, he
stood up and prayed, so filled with the grace of God that for two
hours he could not stop, and those who heard him were astonished,
and many regretted that they had come out after such a
venerable old man.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_250"><b class="pb">{Page 250}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>When at length he concluded his prayer, after remembering
all the people he had ever met, great and small, famous and
obscure, and the whole catholic church all over the world, when
the time came to leave they mounted him upon an ass and took
him into the city: it was a festival sabbath day. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The chief of
police Herod and his father Nicetes met him, and took him into
their carriage and sitting beside him tried to persuade him saying,
“Why, what harm is there in saying ‘Caesar is Lord,’ and burning
the incense, and so on, and saving yourself?” At first he made
them no answer, but when they persisted, he said, “I am not going
to do what you advise me.” <sup class="verse">3 </sup>When they failed to persuade him,
they spoke threateningly to him, and put him out of the carriage
so hastily that as he got out of it he hurt his shin. Without turning
around, he went eagerly on without noticing it, and was
taken to the arena, when the uproar in the arena was so great
that nobody could be heard.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>As Polycarp entered the arena, there came to him a voice from
heaven,</p>

<p>“Be strong, Polycarp, and act like a man.”</p>

<p>Nobody saw the one who spoke, but those of our people who
were there heard the voice. When at length he was brought
forward there was a great uproar when they heard that Polycarp
had been taken. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So when he was brought forward the governor
asked him if he was Polycarp and when he admitted that he was,
he tried to persuade him to deny the faith, saying to him,</p>

<p>“Have some regard for you age,” and so on, as they usually
say. “Swear by the fortune of Caesar; change your mind, and
say, ‘Kill the atheists.’”</p>

<p>But Polycarp looked with an earnest face at all the throng of
lawless heathen in the arena, waved his hand at them and
groaned, and looking up to heaven said,</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“Kill the atheists!” And when the governor insisted, saying,</p>

<p>“Take the oath, and I will let you go; revile Christ,” Polycarp
said,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_251"><b class="pb">{Page 251}</b></span></p>

<p>“For eighty-six years I have been his slave, and he has done
me no wrong; how can I blaspheme my king who has saved me?”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>When he still insisted, and said,</p>

<p>“Swear by the fortune of Caesar,” he answered,</p>

<p>“If you imagine that I will swear by the fortune of Caesar, as
you say, and pretend not to know who I am, let me tell you
plainly, I am a Christian. And if you want to learn the doctrine of
Christianity, set a day and hear me.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>The governor said,</p>

<p>“Convince the people.”</p>

<p>Polycarp said,</p>

<p>“I thought you worth reasoning with; for we have been taught
to pay suitable honour to governments and authorities, appointed
by God, if it does us no harm; but as for these others, I do not
think they are worth my defending myself before them.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>The governor said,</p>

<p>“I have wild animals; I will throw you to them, unless you
change your mind.”</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<p>“Call them, for to change from the better to the worse is impossible
for us, but it is right to change from violence to uprightness.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>He said to him again,</p>

<p>“Since you despise wild animals, I will have you consumed
with fire, if you do not change your mind.”</p>

<p>Polycarp said,</p>

<p>“You threaten me with the fire that burns for an hour and in a
little while goes out, for you do not know about the fire of the
coming judgment and everlasting punishment, which is reserved
for the wicked. But why do you wait? Bring on whatever you
please.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>Saying this and much more he was filled with courage and joy,
and his face was filled with graciousness, so that not only did he
not collapse at what was said to him, but on the contrary the governor
<span class="pb" id="page_252"><b class="pb">{Page 252}</b></span>
was amazed and sent his own herald to the middle of the
arena to announce three times.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Polycarp has acknowledged that he is a Christian.” When the
herald said this, the whole throng of heathen and Jews living in
Smyrna, in uncontrollable anger and with a great roar, shouted
back,</p>

<p>“This fellow is the teacher of Asia, the father of the Christians,
the destroyer of our gods, who teaches many people not to sacrifice
or worship.”</p>

<p>They shouted these words at the Asiarch Philip, and asked him
to let loose a lion upon Polycarp. But he said it was not lawful
for him to do so, since he had closed the wild-animal sports. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Then
they decided to shout to him in concert to have Polycarp burned
alive. For the matter of the vision he had had about his pillow
had to be fulfilled, when he saw it on fire as he was praying, and
turned and said prophetically to the faithful about him,</p>

<p>“I must be burned alive.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">13 </b>This then happened with such speed, more quickly than words
could say it, for the mob immediately collected sticks and firewood
from the shops and baths, Jews as usual being especially
eager to help in this. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>When the pyre was ready, he himself took
off all his clothes and unfastened his belt, and tried also to take
off his shoes, though he was not in the habit of doing this before,
because each of the faithful was always eager to be the first to
touch his flesh. For because of his excellent life he had been
treated even before his martyrdom with the utmost consideration.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the appliances attached to the pyre were immediately put on
him, but when they started to nail him too, he said,</p>

<p>“Leave me as I am, for he who enables me to endure the fire
will also enable me to stay on the pyre without moving, without
your fastening me with nails.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">14 </b>So they did not nail him, but tied him. And he put his hands
behind him and was tied in place, like a splendid ram out of a
great flock, to be sacrificed, a burnt offering acceptable to God
made ready, and he looked up to heaven and said,</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_253"><b class="pb">{Page 253}</b></span></p>

<p>“Lord God Almighty, Father of thy beloved and blessed child
Jesus Christ, through whom we have received the knowledge of
thee, God of angels and hosts and all creation, and of the whole
race of the upright who live in thy presence, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>I bless thee that
thou hast thought me worthy of this day and hour, to be numbered
among the martyrs and share in the cup of thy Christ, for
resurrection to eternal life, for soul and body in the incorruptibility
of the holy Spirit. Among them may I be accepted before
thee today, as a rich and acceptable sacrifice, just as thou, the
faithful and true God, hast prepared and foreshown and brought
about. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For this reason and for all things I praise thee, I bless
thee, I glorify thee, through the eternal heavenly high priest
Jesus Christ, thy beloved child, through whom be glory to thee
with him and the holy Spirit now and for the ages to come.
Amen.”</p>

<p><b class="chapter">15 </b>When he had uttered the Amen and finished his prayer, the
men in charge of the fire lighted the fire. And as a great flame
blazed we who were permitted to see it saw a wonder, and have
been preserved to tell the rest what happened. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For the fire assumed
an overarching shape, like the sail of a ship filled by the
wind, and made a wall around the martyr’s body, and it was
there in the centre not like flesh burning but like bread baking,
or like gold and silver being refined in a furnace. For we perceived
such a fragrance as a breath of incense or some other,
precious spice.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">16 </b>At last the wicked men, when they saw that his body could not
be consumed by the fire, ordered an executioner to go up and
stab him with a dagger. And when he did so, a dove and a
quantity of blood came out, so that it put out the fire, and all the
people wondered if there was such a difference between the unbelievers
and God’s chosen, <sup class="verse">2 </sup>of whom this most wonderful Polycarp
had been one, and shown himself an apostolic and prophetic
teacher in our times, and bishop of the catholic church at Smyrna.
For every word that he uttered with his month has been fulfilled
and will be fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_254"><b class="pb">{Page 254}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">17 </b>But the jealous, envious Evil One, the adversary of the race
of the upright, when he saw the greatness of his martyrdom, and
his irreproachable life from the beginning, and that he was now
crowned with the wreath of immortality and had won an incontestable
prize, took care that not even his corpse should be taken
away by us, though many desired to take it and to touch his holy
remains. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So he instigated Nicetes, the father of Herod and the
brother of Alce, to petition the governor not to give up his body,</p>

<p>“For fear,” he said, “they may leave the one who was crucified
and begin to worship this man.”</p>

<p>He said this at the instigation and insistence of the Jews who
also watched us when we were going to take him out of the fire—unaware
that we shall never be able to desert Christ who suffered
for the salvation of the whole world of those who are saved,
the blameless for the sinners, or to worship anyone else. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For we
worship him as the Son of God, but we love the martyrs as disciples
and imitators of the Lord, and rightly so, for their unsurpassable
devotion to their king and teacher. May we too prove to be
their partners and fellow disciples.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">18 </b>Then the captain, when he saw the dispute occasioned by the
Jews, put the body in the middle of the fire, as they are accustomed
to do, and burned it. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>So we afterward picked up his bones,
which are more valuable than precious stones and better than
gold, and laid them in a suitable place. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>As we gather there as
often as we can with joy and exultation the Lord will permit us
to observe the day of his martyrdom as a birthday, in memory of
those who have already competed, and the preparation and training
of those who are to do so.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">19 </b>Such is the story of the blessed Polycarp who though he was
the twelfth, including those from Philadelphia, to suffer martyrdom
at Smyrna, is the only one particularly remembered by
everybody, so that he is talked of even by the heathen everywhere.
He was not only a distinguished teacher, but a notable
martyr, whose martyrdom all desire to imitate, for it followed
<span class="pb" id="page_255"><b class="pb">{Page 255}</b></span>
the pattern of the gospel of Christ. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>By his endurance he defeated
the unjust governor and thus won the wreath of immortality, and
rejoices with the apostles and all the upright, glorifying the Almighty
God and Father and blessing our Lord Jesus Christ, the
saviour of our souls and the pilot of our bodies and the shepherd
of the catholic church which is all over the world.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">20 </b>You asked to have what has happened explained to you in full,
but for the present we have reported them in brief through our
brother Marcion. So when you have received this information,
send the letter to the brethren beyond you, so that they too may
glorify the Lord who makes selections from his slaves.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>Now to him who is able to bring us all by his favour and
bounty into his eternal kingdom through his only child Jesus
Christ be glory, power, honour, and majesty forever! Greet
all God’s people. Those who are with us greet you, and so
does Euarestus, who writes the letter, and his whole household.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">21 </b>Now the blessed Polycarp was martyred on the second, early
in the month of Xanthicus, on the seventh day before the kalends
of March, a high sabbath, at two o’clock. He was arrested by
Herod, when Philip of Tralles was high priest, and Statius Quadratus
was governor, but our Lord Jesus Christ was reigning forever.
To him be glory, honour, majesty and eternal dominion from
generation to generation. Amen.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">22 </b>We bid you farewell, brethren, as you live by the teaching of
Jesus Christ in the gospel; with him be glory to our God and
Father and the holy Spirit for the salvation of his chosen saints
just as the blessed Polycarp suffered martyrdom. May we too be
found in his footsteps in the kingdom of Jesus Christ!</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>This account Gaius copied from that of Irenaeus, a disciple of
Polycarp; he lived with Irenaeus. I, Socrates, wrote it out in
Corinth from the copy of Gaius. Grace be with you all.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>Again, I, Pionius, searched it out and wrote it out from the
earlier copy, when the blessed Polycarp disclosed it to me in a
<span class="pb" id="page_256"><b class="pb">{Page 256}</b></span>
vision, as I will explain later. I gathered it together, when it was
almost worn out by age; the Lord Jesus Christ gather me also
with his chosen into his heavenly kingdom! To him be glory with
the Father and the holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><i>Another form of conclusion in place of verses 2 and 3,
from the Moscow manuscript</i></p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>This account Gaius copied from the papers of Irenaeus, and
he had also lived with Irenaeus, who had been a disciple of the
holy Polycarp. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For this Irenaeus was in Rome at the time of the
martyrdom of the bishop Polycarp, and taught many. Many most
excellent and sound writings of his are current, in which he mentions
Polycarp, saying that he had been his pupil. He ably refuted
every heresy and handed down the generally accepted rule of
the church, just as he had received it from the saint. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And he says
this also, that once when Marcion, after whom the Marcionites
were named, met the holy Polycarp, and said,</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“Recognize me, Polycarp,” he said to Marcion,</p>

<p>“I recognize you! I recognize Satan’s first-born.” And this also
is recorded in the writings of Irenaeus, that on the day and at
the hour that Polycarp was martyred at Smyrna, Irenaeus, who
was in the city of Rome, heard a voice like a trumpet say, “Polycarp
has been martyred.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">6 </sup>So from these papers of Irenaeus, as already stated, Gaius
made a copy, and from the copy of Gaius Isocrates made another
at Corinth. And again I, Pionius, wrote it out from the copy of
Isocrates, after searching for it in obedience to a revelation of
the holy Polycarp, gathering it together when it was almost worn
out by age; the Lord Jesus Christ gather me also with his chosen
into his heavenly kingdom! To him be glory with the Father and
the Son and the holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_257"><b class="pb">{Page 257}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Apology of Quadratus</h2>

<p>To their heathen contemporaries the early Christians seemed to
be following a degraded superstition, and scandalous stories of
their religious proceedings were in general circulation. As the
new faith came to self-consciousness, it sought to correct these
misapprehensions, and defend itself against such calumnies.
Christians also sought protection from unjust persecution. So
arose the apologies, or defences of Christianity. The first such
literary effort was the so-called Preaching of Peter, which has
almost entirely disappeared, except in so far as it was reproduced
in the <i>Apology</i> of Aristides, A.D. 138-147. But the first substantial
piece of this literature that has come down to us is from the
Apology of Quadratus.</p>

<p>Hadrian visited Athens in A.D. 125 and it was probably then,
or possibly on his next visit there, four years later, that Quadratus,
a Christian philosopher of that city, presented to him a defence
of the Christians. All that we know of this we learn from
Eusebius, for what Jerome says about it, he evidently learned
from him. Eusebius tells the story, and quotes a sentence or two
from the Apology.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_258"><b class="pb">{Page 258}</b></span></p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_259"><b class="pb">{Page 259}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Apology of Quadratus: A Fragment</h2>

<p>After Trajan had reigned for twenty whole years lacking six
months, Aelius Hadrian succeeded to the imperial authority.
To him Quadratus addressed and presented a discourse, having
composed a defense of our religion because some wicked men
were trying to annoy our people. The work is still current among
most of the brethren, and is in my hands, and from it it is possible
to recognize clear proofs of the man’s intelligence and of his
apostolic orthodoxy. He himself reveals his own early date in his
own words when he says,</p>

<p>“But the works of our Savior were always present, for they
were real—those who had been cured, those who had been raised
from the dead, who were seen not only when they were cured
and raised, but always when they were present, and not only,
while the Savior was on earth, but after he was gone, they survived
for a long time, so that some of them lived even to our day.”</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_261"><b class="pb">{Page 261}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Fragments of Papias</h2>

<p>In the second quarter of the second century there lived in the
Phrygian city of Hierapolis, in Asia, a Christian named Papias
who whenever he met an elderly believer who might have known
people who had ever seen or heard any of the original apostles,
eagerly questioned him and wrote down what he had to tell.
These reports about A.D. 140, or perhaps a little later, he put into
a book of his own, the <i>Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord.</i></p>

<p>While this book has disappeared, Irenaeus and Eusebius read
it and quoted it, and though Eusebius thought little of Papias’s
judgment, what they took from it shows that it contained some
material of importance and value. Many later Christian writers
reflect it—Jerome (†420), Philip of Side (about A.D. 430), Andreas
of Caesarea (late sixth century), Maximus the Confessor
(†662), Anastasius of Sinai († about A.D. 700), Georgius Hamartolus
(about A.D. 842), and Photius (A.D. 890). It is clear that his
book was still read at the end of the ninth century, and old library
catalogues at Nismes and Stems show that it still existed in
A.D. 1218 and A.D. 1341.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_263"><b class="pb">{Page 263}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Fragments of Papias</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><sup class="verse">1 </sup>When creation, renewed and liberated, shall yield an abundance
of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven and the fertility
of the earth, just as the elders, who saw John, the disciple of the
Lord, related that they had heard how the Lord would teach
about those times and say,</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“The days will come when vines will grow each with ten thousand
shoots, and ten thousand branches on each shoot, and ten
thousand twigs on each branch, and ten thousand clusters on
each twig, and ten thousand grapes in each cluster, and each
grape, when crushed will yield twenty-five jars of wine. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And
when one of the saints takes hold of a cluster, another cluster
will cry out, ‘I am better, take me, bless the Lord through me.’
In the same way a grain of wheat will produce ten thousand
heads, and every head will have ten thousand grains, and every
grain will produce ten pounds of fine flour, bright and clean.
And other fruits, seeds and grass will produce in corresponding
proportions. And all the animals will use those foods that are the
products of the soil and become in turn peaceable and in harmony
with one another, and in complete subjection to man.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">4 </sup>This is also attested in writing by Papias, who was a hearer of
John and a comrade of Polycarp, an ancient man, in his fourth
book, for there are five books that were composed by him. And
he goes on to say,</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>“But to believers these things are credible. And,” he says,
“when Judas, the betrayer, refused to believe and asked, ‘How
<span class="pb" id="page_264"><b class="pb">{Page 264}</b></span>
will such production be effected by the Lord?’ the Lord said,
‘Those who reach those times will see.’”
Irenaeus, <i>Against Heresies</i>, 5.33.3-4.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p><sup class="verse">1 </sup>There are five books of Papias extant, and they are entitled
<i>Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord</i>. Irenaeus also mentions
these as the only works written by him, saying something like
this: “This also” etc. [compare Irenaeus, 5.33.4 above]. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>These
are the words of Irenaeus. But Papias himself, in the preface to
his discourses, does not at all assert that he was himself a hearer
and eyewitness of the holy apostles, but shows by the language
he uses that he received the matters of the faith from those who
were acquainted with them:</p>

<p><sup class="verse">3 </sup>“But I will not hesitate to put down along with my interpretations
whatever I carefully learned at any time from the elders,
and carefuly remembered, assuring you of their truth. For I did
not, like most people, enjoy those who have much to say, but
those who taught what was true; nor those who relate commands
of others, but those who report the ones given by the Lord to
the faith and proceeding from the truth itself. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And if anyone
should come my way who had been a follower of the elders, I
would ask for the accounts given by the elders—what Andrew
or what Peter said, or what Philip or what Thomas or James, or
what John or Matthew said, or any other of the disciples of the
Lord, and what Aristion and the elder John, the disciples of the
Lord, say. For I did not think that the contents of books would
profit me as much as what came from the living and surviving
voice.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">5 </sup>Here it is worth noting that he twice lists the name of John.
The first one he mentions along with Peter and James and Matthew
and the rest of the apostles, clearly meaning the evangelist,
but the other John, after an interval, he classes with others outside
the number of the apostles, putting Aristion before him, and
<span class="pb" id="page_265"><b class="pb">{Page 265}</b></span>
distinctly calls him an elder; <sup class="verse">6 </sup>so that by this he shows that the
statement of those is true who say that two men in Asia had the
same name, and that there are two tombs in Ephesus, and each
is still called John’s. It is necessary to take note of this, for it is
probable that it was the second, if one is not willing to accept
the first, that saw the Revelation that is current under the name
of John. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>And Papias, of whom I am now speaking, acknowledges
that he received the sayings of the apostles from those that had
followed them, but says that he was himself a hearer of Aristion
and John the Elder. Anyway he mentions them frequently by
name and includes traditions of theirs in his writings. These matters
I hope have been not unprofitably related by me.</p>

<p><sup class="verse">8 </sup>It is worth while to add to the utterances of Papias that have
been given, some others of his, in which he relates other wonderful
things as having been handed down to him by tradition. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>That
Philip the apostle lived in Hierapolis with his daughters has
already been stated, but it must here be pointed out that Papias,
who was their contemporary, mentions that he heard a marvellous
story from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that in his time
a man rose from the dead. And again he tells another wonderful
story about Justus, who was called Barsabbas, that he drank a
deadly poison, and yet, by the Lord’s favour, experienced nothing
unpleasant. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>This Justus the Book of Acts records that the holy
apostles after the ascension of the Saviour put forward with Matthias,
and prayed that one might be chosen in place of the betrayer
Judas, to fill out their number. This is its account: “Then
they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas who was known
as Justus, and Matthias, and they prayed, saying.” <sup class="verse">11 </sup>The same
writer has recorded other matters also as coming to him from unwritten
tradition, strange parables and teachings of the Saviour,
and some other more mythical statements. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>Among others he says
that there will be about a thousand years after the resurrection
from the dead, and then Christ’s kingdom will be set up in bodily
form here on this earth. I suppose he got these ideas through
misconstruing the accounts of the apostles, without perceiving
<span class="pb" id="page_266"><b class="pb">{Page 266}</b></span>
that the things they said were uttered in figures, mystically. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>For
he appears to have been a man of very limited understanding, as
one can say judging from his own statements. Yet he was to blame
that so many ecclesiastical writers after him adopted a like opinion,
urging the antiquity of the man in its support, as for instance
Irenaeus and anyone else who has held and maintained such
views. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>And in his own writing he hands down other accounts,
given by Aristion, who has already been mentioned, of the Lord’s
sayings, and traditions of John the Elder, to which we refer the
inquiring, but I must add to his utterances already quoted a tradition
about Mark who wrote the gospel, which he sets forth in
the following words:</p>

<p><sup class="verse">15 </sup>“The Elder said this also: Mark had been the interpreter of
Peter, and wrote down accurately, though not in order, everything
that he remembered that had been said or done by the
Lord. For he neither heard the Lord nor followed him, but afterward,
as I said, attended Peter, who adapted his instructions to
the needs of his hearers, but had no design of giving a connected
account of the Lord’s oracles. So then Mark made no mistake in
thus writing some things as he remembered them; for he made
it his one concern not to omit anything that he had heard, or to
make any false statement in them.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">16 </sup>This, then, is what Papias relates about Mark. But about Matthew
he says this: “So Matthew composed the Sayings in the
Aramaic language, and everyone translated them as well as he
could.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">17 </sup>The same man uses proofs from the first epistle of John and
likewise from the epistle of Peter. And he relates another story
about a woman who was accused of many sins before the Lord,
which the Gospel according to the Hebrews contains. And this
also we must certainly take account of, in addition to what has
been stated.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Apollinarius: “Judas did not die by hanging, but lived on, having
been taken down before he choked to death. And the Acts of
the Apostles show this, saying that he swelled up, and burst open
in the middle, and his vitals poured out. Papias, the disciple of
John, records this more plainly in the fourth book of the <i>Interpretation
of the Sayings of the Lord</i>:</p>

<p><sup class="verse">2 </sup>“Judas went about this world a terrible example of impiety,
with his flesh swollen to such size that he could not get through,
not even the bulk of his head, where a wagon could easily pass.
They say that his eyelids swelled so that he could not see the
light at all, and his eyes could not be seen even by a physician
with an instrument, they had sunk so far from the outer surface.
<sup class="verse">3 </sup>. . . He died, they say, after much torment and punishment, in
a place of his own. . . . (The further account of Judas is altogether
repugnant to modern taste.)</p>

<p>Papias says this, word for word: “To some of them (evidently
the angels, who at first were holy), he gave dominion over the
regulation of the earth, and he ordered them to rule well.” He
goes on to say, “But it turned out that their administration came
to naught.”</p>

<p>Andreas of Caesarea, <i>On the Apocalypse</i>, ch. 34, Serm. 12</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>As to the inspiration of the book (that is, the Revelation of
John) I think it is unnecessary to speak at length, since the
blessed Gregory (I mean the Theologian) and Cyril bear witness
<span class="pb" id="page_268"><b class="pb">{Page 268}</b></span>
to its genuineness, as well as those of earlier times, Papias, Irenaeus,
Methodius, and Hippolytus.</p>

<p>Starting from Papias the great, of Hierapolis, who was intimate
with him who leaned on Christ’s bosom, and Clement and Pantaenus
the priest of Alexandria, and the most wise Ammonius,
the ancient interpreters before the councils, who understood the
whole work of the six days of Christ and the church.</p>

<p>So the more ancient interpreters of the church, I mean Philo, the
philosopher and contemporary of the apostles, and the famous
Papias of Hierapolis, the pupil of John the evangelist . . . and
their associates viewed the references to paradise spiritually, and
applied them to the church of Christ.</p>

<p>He says this hinting, I suppose, at Papias, who was then bishop
of Hierapolis in Asia, and flourished in the days of the holy
evangelist John. For this Papias in the fourth book of his <i>Interpretations
of the Sayings of the Lord</i> mentioned the enjoyment
of food in the resurrection. . . . And Irenaeus of Lyons says the
same thing in the fifth book of his work <i>Against Heresies</i>, and
cites the Papias already mentioned in support of his statements.</p>

<i>On Dionysius the Areopagite</i>, ch. 7.</p>

<p>Nor again does Stephen follow Papias, the bishop and martyr
of Hierapolis, nor Irenaeus, the holy bishop of Lyons, when they
say that the kingdom of heaven will be enjoyment of certain
material foods.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p><sup class="verse">1 </sup>Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, who had been a hearer of John
the Theologian, and a companion of Polycarp, wrote five books
of Sayings of the Lord. In them, in giving a list of the apostles,
after Peter and John, Philip and Thomas and Matthew, he included
among disciples of the Lord Aristion and another John,
whom he also called the Elder. (He says) that some think that
the two short general letters which bear the name of John are
the work of this John, because the ancients accept only the first
epistle. Some have mistakenly considered the Revelation also to
be by him. Papias is also wrong about the Millennium, and Irenaeus
also, after him. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Papias says in his second book that John the
Theologian and James his brother were killed by Jews. The
above-mentioned Papias related, stating that he had it from the
<span class="pb" id="page_270"><b class="pb">{Page 270}</b></span>
daughters of Philip, that Barsabbas, also called Justus, when he
was put to the test by the unbelievers, drank viper’s poison in
the name of Christ and was preserved unharmed. He records
other marvels also, and particularly the one about Menahem’s
mother, who rose from the dead. As for those raised from the
dead by Christ, he says that they lived until the times of Hadrian.</p>

<p>Philip of Side, <i>Church History</i></p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p><sup class="verse">1 </sup>After Domitian, Nerva reigned for one year. He recalled John
from the island to live in Ephesus. He was at that time the sole
survivor of the twelve apostles, and after writing the gospel that
bears his name he was thought worthy of martyrdom. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For Papias,
bishop of Hierapolis, who was an eyewitness of him, says in the
second book of the <i>Sayings of the Lord</i>, that he was killed by
Jews, manifestly fulfilling with his brother Christ’s prophecy
about them, and their own confession and agreement about this.
For when the Lord said to them, “Can you drink the cup that I
am drinking?” and they eagerly assented and agreed, he said, “You
shall drink my cup, and undergo the baptism that I am undergoing.”
And this was natural, for it is impossible that God should
speak falsely. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>So the learned Origen too in his interpretation of
Matthew asserts that John suffered martyrdom, indicating that
he had learned this from the successors of the apostles. In fact
the very learned Eusebius says in his <i>Church History</i>, “Parthia
was allotted to Thomas, and Asia to John. There he lived for
some time, and died in Ephesus.”</p>

<p><sup class="verse">1 </sup>Here begins the summary of the Gospel according to John.
The Gospel of John was made known and given to the churches
by John while he was still in the body, as one Papias by name,

of Hierapolis, a beloved disciple of John, has related in his <i>Interpretations</i>,
that is, in the last five books. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>[But he wrote the gospel
down correctly at John’s dictation. But the heretic Marcion, since
he had been disapproved by him, because he disagreed with him,
was disowned by John. But he had brought him writings or

<h2>The Address to Diognetus</h2>

<p>Eighty years ago there was in the city library of Strasbourg
a Greek manuscript of the thirteenth or fourteenth century containing
works mistakenly ascribed to Justin. Among these was a
fragment of ten or twelve pages in defence of the Christians,
addressed or dedicated to Diognetus, probably meaning Aurelius’
tutor of that name. The manuscript was destroyed in the
burning of the library during the siege of the city in 1870, and
the fragment has never been found in any other manuscript, nor
has any mention of the work or quotation from it ever been
found in any work of early Christian literature. In form it is not
a letter, though it is usually called one, but is more like an address
or apology.</p>

<p>The text is broken at 7.7 and 10.1, and chapters 11 and 12 are
from another work and author, perhaps a homily by Methodius,
Hippolytus, or even Melito.</p>

<p>Chapters 1-10 are very rhetorical in style; the writer revels in
antitheses, and seems more concerned with his style than with
his theme. The work has none of the sense of stern reality that
pervades genuine Christian apologies. It even suggests that it
may not be a work of antiquity at all, but a composition of some
humanist of the Renaissance, though its apparent acquaintance
with the <i>Apology</i> of Aristides is against this. The writer declares
that Christians are in the world what the soul is in the body. He
<span class="pb" id="page_274"><b class="pb">{Page 274}</b></span>
denounces idolatry and the animal sacrifices of the Jews. If the
piece is an ancient work, as most scholars hold, it probably belongs
to the third century.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_275"><b class="pb">{Page 275}</b></span></p>

<h2>The Address to Diognetus</h2>

<p><b class="chapter">1 </b>Since I see, your Excellency Diognetus, that you are more than
eager to learn the religion of the Christians, and to raise very
clear and careful questions about them, what God they believe
in, and how they worship him, so that they all disdain the world,
and despise death, and disregard those whom the Greeks
consider gods, and do not observe the superstition of the Jews;
and what strong affection they have for one another, and what
this new race or way of life that has come into life now and not
before can be, I welcome this eagerness of yours, and I ask God,
who empowers us both to speak and to listen, to enable me to
speak in such a way that you may be made better by hearing,
and that you may hear in such a way that the speaker may not
be sorry.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">2 </b>Come, then, free yourself from all the prejudices that occupy
your mind, and lay aside the habit of mind that deceives you, and
become as it were a new man, from the beginning, as if you were
about to hear a new doctrine, as you yourself admit, and see not
only with your eyes but with your intelligence, of what substance
or what shape those whom you call gods and regard as such happen
to be. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Is not one of them stone, like what you tread on, and
another bronze, no better than vessels made of bronze for our use,
and another wood, already rotten, and another silver, which needs
a man to keep it from being stolen, and another iron, mined by
rust, and another pottery, no handsomer than what is produced
<span class="pb" id="page_276"><b class="pb">{Page 276}</b></span>
for the lowest use? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Are not all of them made of perishable material?
Were they not forged with iron and fire? Did not a sculptor
make one, a coppersmith another, a silversmith another, and a
potter another? Before they were shaped by their skill into the
forms they have, was it not possible—is it not even now—for
each of them to have been shaped into something else? Might
not dishes which are now of the same material, if they should
fall into the hands of the same craftsmen, be made like these?
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Could not these again which are now worshipped by you be
made by men into dishes like the rest? Are they not all dumb?
Are they not blind? Are they not lifeless? Are they not insensible? Are
they not motionless? Do they not all decay? Do they not all perish?
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>You call these things gods, you serve them, you worship them,
and finally you become like them. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>This is why you hate the
Christians—because they do not think these are gods. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For, though
you think and suppose you are praising them, are you not despising
them much more yourselves? Are you not mocking and insulting
them much more when you worship the stone and pottery
ones without guarding them, but look up the silver and gold
ones at night and set guards over them by day, to keep them
from being stolen? <sup class="verse">8 </sup>With the honours you think you are offering
them, if they have any perception, you are punishing them instead;
but if they have not, you convict them of it when you
worship them with blood and steaming fat. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Let one of you undergo
this sort of thing! Let him endure having these things done to
him! Why, there is not a single human being who would consent
to endure this punishment, for he can feel and think. But the
stone endures it, for it cannot feel. Do you not, then, prove that it
has no sense perception? <sup class="verse">10 </sup>So as to the fact that Christians are not
enslaved to such gods, I could have much else to say, but if what I
have said should seem to anyone insufficient, I think it is superfluous
to say any more.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">3 </b>And next I suppose you are especially longing to hear about
their not worshipping in the same way as Jews. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Jews indeed, in refraining
<span class="pb" id="page_277"><b class="pb">{Page 277}</b></span>
from this service already described, are right in claiming
to worship one God and Master of all, but in so far as they offer
him this worship in the same way as those already described they
are wrong. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For while the Greeks in making these offerings to
things that cannot feel or hear, show their folly, these others supposing
they make offerings to God as though he needed them,
should consider it folly, not worship. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For he who made heaven
and earth and all that is in them, and provides all of us with
what we need, would not himself need any of the things which
he provides for those who think they are giving them. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>But those
who think they can offer sacrifices to him with blood and steaming
fat and burnt offerings, and distinguish him with these
honours, seem to me not to differ at all from those who show the
same consideration to dumb objects; the latter offer it to things
that cannot enjoy the honour, while the former think they offer
it to the one who is in need of nothing.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">4 </b>But surely that their timidity about food and superstition about
the sabbath and pride in circumcision and pretence of fasting
and New Moon are ridiculous and unworthy of discussion, I do
not think you need to have me tell you. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For why is it not godless
to accept some of the things created by God for man’s use as
well created, and to reject others as useless and superfluous? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And
why is it not impious to lie against God as forbidding us to do
any good thing on the sabbath day? <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And why is it not ridiculous
to boast of the mutilation of the flesh as proof of divine selection,
as if they were especially beloved by God on account of it? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>And
as for their watching the stars and the moon to ensure the observance
of the months and days, and their making differences
among the arrangements of God and the changes of the seasons
according to their own inclinations, making some into feasts and
some into times of mourning, who would think it an example of
piety and not much more of folly? <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Therefore, that Christians are
right in abstaining from the general silliness and error and from
the fussiness and arrogance of the Jews I suppose you are sufficiently
<span class="pb" id="page_278"><b class="pb">{Page 278}</b></span>
informed. But you must not expect that you can learn
from any man the mystery of their own religion.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">5 </b>For Christians are not distinguished from the rest of mankind
in country or speech or customs. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For they do not live somewhere
in cities of their own or use some distinctive language or practise
a peculiar manner of life. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>They have no learning discovered by
the thought and reflection of inquisitive men, nor are they the
authors of any human doctrine, like some men. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Though they live
in Greek and barbarian cities, as each man’s lot is cast, and follow
the local customs in dress and food and the rest of their living,
their own way of life which they display is wonderful and
admittedly strange. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>They live in their native lands, but like
foreigners. They take part in everything like citizens, and endure
everything like aliens. Every foreign country is their native land,
and every native land a foreign country. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Like everyone else they
marry, they have children, but they do not expose their infants.
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>They set a common table, but not a common bed. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>They find
themselves in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>They
remain on earth, but they are citizens of heaven. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>They obey the
established laws, and in their own lives they surpass the laws.
<sup class="verse">11 </sup>They love all men, and are persecuted by all men. <sup class="verse">12 </sup>They are unknown,
and they are condemned; they are put to death, and they
are made alive. <sup class="verse">13 </sup>They are poor, and they make many rich. They
are in need of all things, and they abound in all things. <sup class="verse">14 </sup>They are
dishonoured, and in their dishonour they are glorified. They are
abused, and they are vindicated. <sup class="verse">15 </sup>They are reviled, and they
bless. They are insulted, and they do honour. <sup class="verse">16 </sup>When they do good,
they are punished as evildoers; when they are punished, they rejoice
as though they were being made alive. <sup class="verse">17 </sup>By the Jews they are
warred upon as aliens, and by the Greeks they are persecuted,
and those who hate them cannot give a reason for their hostility.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">6 </b>To put it briefly, what the soul is to the body, Christians are
to the world. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>The soul is scattered through all the parts of the
body, and Christians are, through all the cities of the world. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>The
soul lives in the body, but it is not of the body; Christians also
<span class="pb" id="page_279"><b class="pb">{Page 279}</b></span>
live in the world, but they are not of the world. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>The soul which is
invisible is imprisoned in the body which is visible, and Christians
are known to be in the world, but their religion remains invisible.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>The flesh hates the soul and wars against it, though it is done no
wrong, because it is hindered from enjoying its pleasures; the
world hates Christians too, though it is done no wrong, because
they oppose its pleasures. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>The soul loves the flesh which hates it,
and loves its members, and Christians love those who hate them.
<sup class="verse">7 </sup>The soul is shut up in the body, but itself holds the body together;
and Christians are kept in the world as in a prison, but themselves
hold the world together. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>The soul, though it is immortal, lives in
a mortal tent, and Christians live as strangers in perishable ones,
waiting for immortality in heaven. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>When the soul is badly treated
in food and drink it is made better; and Christians when they are
punished increase the more in number every day. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>To so high a
station God has appointed them, and it is not right for them to
refuse it.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">7 </b>For as I said it is no mere earthly discovery that was committed
to them, nor is it a mortal idea that they think fit to guard
so carefully, nor have they been entrusted with merely human
secrets. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>But in reality the omnipotent, all-creating, invisible God
from heaven introduced among men the truth and the holy and
incomprehensible word and has established it in their hearts, not
as one might imagine, sending men some servant or angel or ruler,
or one of those who manage things on earth, or one of those who
have been entrusted with the administration of affairs in heaven,
but the designer and creator of the universe himself, by whom he
created the heavens, by whom he enclosed the sea in its own
limits, whose secrets all the elements faithfully keep, from whom
the sun has received the measures of the courses of the day to
keep, whom the moon obeys when he commands her to shine at
night, whom the stars obey, as they follow the course of the moon;
by whom all things have been constituted and had their limits set
and made subject, the heavens and the things in the heavens, the
earth and the things on the earth, the sea and the things in the
<span class="pb" id="page_280"><b class="pb">{Page 280}</b></span>
sea, fire, air, abyss, the things in the heights, the things in the
deeps, the things between—him he sent to them. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>Did he though
do it as a man might suppose, like a tyrant with fear and terror?
<sup class="verse">4 </sup>Not at all. But with gentleness and meekness, like a king sending
his son, he sent him as king, he sent him as God, he sent him as
man to men; he sent as seeking to save, as persuading, not
compelling, for compulsion is not the way of God. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>He sent as one
calling, not pursuing; he sent as one loving, not judging. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For he
will send him as judge, and who will endure his coming? . . . <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Can
you not see them thrown to wild beasts, to make them deny their
Lord, and yet not overcome? <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Do you not see that the more of
them are punished, the more numerous the others become? <sup class="verse">9 </sup>These
do not seem to be the works of man, they are the power of God,
they are signs of his coming.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">8 </b>For what man knew at all what God was, before he came? <sup class="verse">2 </sup>Or
do you accept the empty, silly accounts of the recognized philosophers,
some of whom said that God was fire (they call that God
to which they will go!), and others, water, and others some other
one of the elements created by God? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And yet if any of these statements
is worth accepting, every other created thing could be pronounced
God. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>But this is marvel-talk and imposture of tricksters.
<sup class="verse">5 </sup>No man has ever seen him or discovered him, but he has revealed
himself. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>And he has revealed himself through faith, through which
alone it is granted to see God. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>For God, the master and creator
of the universe, who made all things and put them in order, was
not only kind, but long-suffering as well. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Why, he always was,
and is and will be so—kindly, good, free from anger, true, and he
alone is good. <sup class="verse">9 </sup>He formed a great, marvellous plan and communicated
it to his child alone. <sup class="verse">10 </sup>So as long as he kept it secret and kept
his own wise counsel, he seemed to neglect and disregard us, <sup class="verse">11 </sup>but
when through his beloved child he revealed and displayed what
he had prepared from the beginning, he gave us everything at
once, both to share his benefits and to see and understand things
that none of us would ever have expected.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_281"><b class="pb">{Page 281}</b></span></p>

<p><b class="chapter">9 </b>So having now arranged everything in his own mind with his
child, in the former time he allowed us to be borne along as we
pleased, by irregular impulses, being carried away by pleasures
and passions, not of course delighting in our sins, but putting up
with them, and not approving that period of iniquity, but creating
this present period of uprightness, in order that we who in
that former period were convicted by our own doings as unworthy
of life might now by the goodness of God be made worthy
of it, and though we had shown that it was impossible for us by
ourselves to enter the kingdom of God, we might by the power
of God be made able. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>And when our iniquity had reached its
fullness and it had been made perfectly clear that punishment
and death were to be expected as its recompense, and the time
came which God had fixed henceforth to display his goodness
and power (oh the surpassing kindness and love of God!) he
did not hate us or reject us or lay it up against us, but he was
long-suffering, forbearing, in his pity he took upon himself our
sins, he himself gave his own Son as a ransom for us, the holy for
the lawless, the innocent for the wicked, the upright for the unrighteous,
the incorruptible for the corruptible, the immortal
for the mortal. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For what else but his uprightness could have
covered our sins? <sup class="verse">4 </sup>Through whom was it possible for us sinful and
ungodly men to be made upright except through the Son of God
alone? <sup class="verse">5 </sup>What a sweet exchange! What an unsearchable operation!
What unexpected beneficence! that through one upright
being the iniquity of many should be concealed, and the
uprightness of one should make many sinful men upright. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>So
having in the former time proved the inability of our nature to
obtain life, and now having revealed the Saviour able to save
even what was incapable of being saved, for both these reasons he
wished us to believe in his goodness, to regard him as nourisher,
father, teacher, counsellor, physician, mind, light, honour, glory,
strength, life, and not to be anxious about food and clothing.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">10 </b>If you also desire this faith, receive first full knowledge of the
<span class="pb" id="page_282"><b class="pb">{Page 282}</b></span>
Father. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For God loved men, for whose sake he had made the
world, and to whom he had subjected everything on earth, to
whom he had given reason and mind, whom alone he had permitted
to look up to him, whom he had formed from his own image,
to whom he sent his only Son, to whom he promised the kingdom
in heaven, and will give it to those who have loved him. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>And
when you get this knowledge, with what joy do you think you
will be filled? Or how will you love him who has thus first loved
you? <sup class="verse">4 </sup>And having loved him you will be an imitator of his goodness.
And do not wonder if a man can be an imitator of God.
He can, if he will. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>For true happiness is not oppressing one’s
neighbours, or wishing to have more than weaker men, or being
rich, or using compulsion on one’s inferiors, nor can a man in
these ways imitate God, but these things are no part of his greatness.
<sup class="verse">6 </sup>But whoever assumes his neighbour’s burden, who wishes to
benefit another who is worse off in that in which he is stronger,
who supplies to those in need what he has received from God,
and becomes a god to those who receive it—he is an imitator of
God. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Then, though you find yourself on earth, you will see that
God lives in heaven, then you will begin to utter divine mysteries,
then you will both love and admire those who are punished for
not being willing to deny God; then you will condemn the deceit
and error of the world when you realize what true life in heaven
is; when you despise what here seems to be death, when you
fear the real death, which is reserved for those who will be condemned
to the eternal fire which will punish unto the end those
delivered to it. <sup class="verse">8 </sup>Then you will admire those who for uprightness
endure the transitory fire, and think them blessed when you understand
that other fire.</p>

<h3>A Fragment of an Ancient Homily</h3>

<p><b class="chapter">11 </b>I have nothing strange to say, nor any surprising questions to
raise, but having been a disciple of apostles I am becoming a
teacher of heathen. It is what has been handed down that I offer
<span class="pb" id="page_283"><b class="pb">{Page 283}</b></span>
worthily to those who are becoming disciples of truth. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For who
that has been rightly taught and has become devoted to the
word does not seek to learn definitely the things that were clearly
shown by word to disciples, to whom the Word appeared and
revealed them, speaking plainly, unperceived by unbelievers,
but relating them to disciples, who being deemed faithful by
him learned the Father’s secrets? <sup class="verse">3 </sup>That is why he sent the Word
to appear to the world, who was dishonoured by the people,
preached through apostles, and believed by heathen. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>It is he
who was from the beginning, who appeared new and proved to
be old, and is ever born young in the hearts of saints. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>He is the
eternal, today counted a son, through whom the church is enriched
and grace unfolding is multiplied in the saints, affording
understanding, revealing secrets, announcing dates, rejoicing
over the faithful, given to those who seek for it, by whom pledges
of faith are not broken and the boundaries set by the fathers are
not passed over. <sup class="verse">6 </sup>Then the fear of the law is praised in song, and
the grace of the prophets is learned, and the faith of the gospels
is established, and what has been handed down from the apostles
is guarded, and the grace of the church exults. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>If you do not
offend this grace, you will learn what the Word talks about
through those through whom he wishes to talk, when he pleases.
For whatever we have been moved painstakingly to utter by the
will of the word that commands us, it is out of love of the things
revealed to us that we come to share them with you.</p>

<p><b class="chapter">12 </b>When you have faced these things and listened earnestly to
them, you will know what God bestows on those who love him
as they should, who become a paradise of delight, causing to grow
in themselves a thriving tree bearing all kinds of fruit, and being
themselves adorned with various fruits. <sup class="verse">2 </sup>For in this place are
planted the tree of knowledge and the tree of life. But the tree
of knowledge does not kill, it is disobedience that kills. <sup class="verse">3 </sup>For the
things that are written leave no doubt that God from the beginning
planted a tree of knowledge and a tree of life in the midst
of paradise, pointing to life through knowledge, and when those
<span class="pb" id="page_284"><b class="pb">{Page 284}</b></span>
first created failed through the serpent’s deceit to use it purely,
they were made naked. <sup class="verse">4 </sup>For there is neither life without knowledge,
nor sound knowledge without true life; therefore they were
planted near each other. <sup class="verse">5 </sup>Seeing the force of this, and censuring
the knowledge which is employed apart from the truth of the
command that leads to life, the apostle said, “Knowledge gives
people airs, but love is what builds up character.” <sup class="verse">6 </sup>For whoever
thinks he knows anything apart from knowledge that is true and
supported by life knows nothing, he is deceived by the serpent,
because he did not love life. But he who recognizes and with
fear pursues life plants in hope, expecting fruit. <sup class="verse">7 </sup>Let your mind
be knowledge, and your life the true message, fully comprehended.
<sup class="verse">8 </sup>If you carry its tree and pick its fruit, you will always
gather the vintage of the things desired by God, which the serpent
cannot touch nor deceit defile by contact. Eve is not corrupted
but trusted as a virgin, <sup class="verse">9 </sup>Salvation is set forth, and apostles are
given understanding, and the Passover of the Lord proceeds, and
the seasons are brought together and are harmonized with the
world, and the Word rejoices in teaching the saints; through him
the Father is glorified. To him be glory forever. Amen.</p>

<h2>Appendix:The Place of the Doctrina in Early Christian Literature</h2>

<p>The Didache and the Doctrina are the Jacob and Esau of early
Christian literature; the younger has stolen the elder’s birthright.
It is now some seventy years since Bryennius discovered the long-lost
Greek Didache (1873) and announced it (1875), and more than
sixty years since he published its text (1883). Its primitive instructions
as to baptism, fasting, prayer, the Lord’s Supper, and the
treatment of visiting missionaries and prophets seemed to reflect a
very early stage in church development, while the identity of much of
its material, 1.1-3a, 2.2-5.2, with that in the latter part of Barnabas,
chapters 18-20, suggested that the writer of one document must have
made use of the other, unless both were indebted to a third. And
more recently it has become clear that this last solution is indeed the
fact. The discovery of the Latin form of the primitive Didache, the
Doctrina, has shown that the Didache derived the so-called “Two
Ways” material from a more primitive Didache, preserved for us only
in a Latin version.</p>

<p>The Didache is a manual of Christian morals and of church procedure.
It retains the name and reproduces more than seven—eighths
of the contents of the Doctrina, which has steadily been dismissed
as a very imperfect translation of the Didache into Latin. But a close
comparison, phrase by phrase, of the relevant parts of Doctrina,
Didache, Barnabas, and the Life of Schnudi shows plainly that the
indebtedness is to the Doctrina, of course in its original Greek; and
that it once existed in Greek can hardly be doubted in view of its
influence on Schnudi, which was composed in Coptic, a literature
far more indebted to Greek than to Latin models.</p>

<p>The history of the four texts would thus appear to be that a short
<span class="pb" id="page_286"><b class="pb">{Page 286}</b></span>
Greek Didache was composed about the year 100 (now lost but
represented by translation in the Doctrina); that a Greek Barnabas
was written about A.D. 130, and appears reflected in the Latin
version of chapters 1—17; that with the aid of this short form of
Barnabas, the primitive Didache was expanded soon after A.D. 150
into the Greek Didache published by Bryennius; and that Barnabas
itself in turn was later with the aid of the primitive Didache expanded
into the present Greek Barnabas.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the Latin documents, Doctrina and
the short Barnabas, are just as truly documents of early Christian
literature as the Greek Barnabas and the Greek Didache, and just
as much entitled to consideration and treatment. To one familiar with
the development of Christian writings in the first, second, and third centuries,
the idea that Doctrina and the short Barnabas were produced,
the latter by lopping off the closing chapters 18-21, and the other
by first making these closing chapters of Barnabas the basis and
beginning of the Didache, and then excerpting them from the Didache
directly into Latin, seems about as improbable as the ancient idea that
the Gospel of Mark was made by condensing Matthew. It hardly
needs to be observed that early Christian literature usually grew not
by partition and reduction, but by combination and expansion.</p>

<p>Even before the publication of the Didache, Krawutzcky in 1882
had very skillfully reconstructed the primitive source of Barnabas,
the Apostolic Church Ordinances and the Apostolic Constitutions, as
the “Two Ways.” The scholars who first examined the Didache and
compared it with Barnabas were quick to see that some common source
about the Two Ways, supposedly Jewish, lay behind these two documents.
Schlecht’s discovery of the De Doctrina Apostolorum, in 1899,
gave learning the very document it had conjectured, and very much
as it had reconstructed it. Yet because it was Latin, not Greek, and
Christian, not Jewish, and did not fit with perfect nicety the picture
that had been made of it, scholars passed it by, and made no place for
it in the second century, or in the third, in Greek or Latin Christian
literature. But such neglect does not dispose of it; it must be dealt
with, and fitted into one’s reconstruction of early Christian literature
at some point and to some purpose.</p>

<p>Nor is there any real difficulty in doing this. For a close comparison
<span class="pb" id="page_287"><b class="pb">{Page 287}</b></span>
of it with Didache and Barnabas shows there is really no objection to
identifying it with precisely the lost Two Ways document long
desiderated. Doctrina is not indeed that identical document, but a
Latin translation of it, and we may well remember that one of the
most important documents of second-century Greek Christianity,
Irenaeus’ Refutation of Gnosticism, has come down to us, as a whole,
only in a Latin translation.</p>

<p>That the Latin translator left out a few lines of his Greek original,
even a paragraph or two, is nothing to boggle at. The ease with which
such omissions may be made, by ancient scribes and modern scholars,
is strikingly shown by the list of Biblical books written into the sixth-century
Codex Claromontanus, which (clearly by mistake) omitted
from its list of Pauline letters Philippians, I and II Thessalonians, and
perhaps Hebrews also, between Ephesians and I Timothy; while
Harnack in printing its list has further omitted from it I, II, and III
John and Jude, between James and Barnabas.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn_1">1</a></sup> Out of a probable thirty-one
items the List originally contained, the Clermont scribe, or his
exemplar, omitted four, and Harnack, four more. The scribe omitted
about one-eighth of the List, and Hamack about one-seventh of what
was left of it. This is recited here only to show how easy it is even
for a modern scholar to omit a string of short items, especially where
what is being copied is not continuous discourse.</p>

<p>Even in a translation, the great bulk of the document is here.
Naturally enough, in Didache, which took over the name of the old
tract which formed its basis, Doctrina’s order is more closely followed,
and its substance is more fully reproduced. In the Greek Barnabas, of
which it formed only a later appendix and afterthought, less of
Doctrina is reproduced, and its order is less regarded.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that, apart from all external evidence, the
internal evidence in both the Greek Barnabas and the Greek Didache
strongly suggests disunity. In the middle of chapter 6, Didache bids
farewell to "this Way of the Teaching” and turns from moral injunction
to prescribing definite church Observances—what food to eat, how to
<span class="pb" id="page_288"><b class="pb">{Page 288}</b></span>
baptize, when to fast, how to pray and how often. These the writer
introduces with the same artless abruptness with which he has let go
of the “Two Ways” tract. “Concerning food,” he begins, “hear what
you can." This is a favourite way with him for introducing new subjects:
“Concerning baptism . . . Concerning the Thanksgiving . . . Concerning
apostles and prophets. . . .”</p>

<p>In the Greek Barnabas the break is less abrupt, but not less noticeable,
for it is marked by the crudest of transitions: “Now let us pass
to a different Gnosis and Didache. There are Two Ways of Didache
and authority. . . .” This practically notifies the reader that he is
now going to read the Didache, in some form or other; but clearly
not in the form exhibited by the Greek Didache found by Bryennius.</p>

<p>Both these Greek documents thus encourage the reader to look
further for the elements they so clumsily put together, and behold!
the Latin Barnabas, lacking the whole Didache section; and the Latin
Doctrina, which substantially supplies it.</p>

<p>It would seem to me immediately apparent that the indubitable
composition of Didache 1.3—2. wholly out of materials from Matthew,
Luke, I Peter, Hermas (Command ii.4-6), and an unknown work
(vs. 6), marks Didache as a secondary, not a primary work. It would
at once suggest that what preceded and what followed (1.1, 2; 2.2 f.)
might also be appropriated from some other work, and the Doctrina
proves to reflect just such a work, though in a Latin translation.
Didache 1-6 is in fact simply a mosaic made up from very early
sources, the chief of which was the Greek original of the Doctrina. To
suppose that original to have been produced by cutting away from
the Bryennius Didache all the materials from Matthew, Luke, I Peter,
Hermas, etc., would seem an unnatural proceeding, almost unprecedented
in early Christian literature.</p>

<p>The Doctrina certainly influenced and in part shaped the Life of
Schnudi and the Apostolic Church Ordinances, as well as the Greek
Didache and the long form of Barnabas, and it also passed into a Latin
version. In these circumstances it seems strange that students of this
literature either neglect it altogether or go so far as to deny its very
existence. In view of the great indebtedness of Coptic literature to
Greek, from which it was largely translated, the use of the Doctrina
materials in Schnudi would seem to establish the existence of Doctrina
<span class="pb" id="page_289"><b class="pb">{Page 289}</b></span>
in Greek, as its reproduction in Didache, Barnabas, and the Apostolic
Church Ordinances plainly suggests. In these circumstances I should
think the existence of a primitive Greek Didache corresponding to the
Latin Doctrina firmly established.</p>

<p>The presence of much of the Two Ways material in the Apostolic
Church Ordinances, about A.D. 300, has long been recognized. Indeed,
the parallels were conveniently set forth side by side with those in the
Apostolic Constitutions, in Hitchcock and Brown’s revised edition of
The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, in 1885, pp. xlvi-lxiv, though the
Church Ordinances were somewhat confusingly designated as the
Apostolic Canons. The opening sentence of the Church Ordinances
is so much like that of Barnabas that it must be derived from it:
“Greeting, sons and daughters, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.”
Barnabas begins, “Greeting, sons and daughters, in the name of the
Lord who has loved us, in peace.” But it is plainly not from Barnabas
but a form of the Doctrina that the Church Ordinances obtained 83 of
the moral injunctions and warnings that it contains. For these include
that entire series, nos. 39—56, so strikingly absent from Barnabas. So,
while the Church Ordinances probably got its opening greeting from
Barnabas, it must have derived these 83 items from some form of the
Doctrina, presumably its Greek original. These are of course enriched
with some later material, but they appear for the most part in just
the order that Doctrina has them in. It is only fair to add that at two
points (after Doctrina’s 1.37 and 1.44) the Church Ordinances has
additional elements not found in Doctrina but present in Didache
(after 37, “some reprove, and for some pray,” and after 44, “Be not
lustful, for lust leads to fornication; nor foul-spoken nor one who lifts
up his eyes; for all these things breed adulteries”) . It would seem that
at these points the Greek Doctrina has sustained slight losses, either
in the course of its Greek transmission or in the course of translation,
or of its Latin transmission. But these five items combined are slight
compared with the loss of Didache 1.3b—2.1, a body of thirty-eight
items, unreflected in Doctrina, Barnabas, Church Ordinances, the
Summary of Doctrine, the Fides Nicaena, and the Life of Schnudi.</p>

<p>For this is not all. The (Pseudo?) Athanasian Syntagma, or Summary,
of Doctrine, which Harnack dated between 350 and 370, and
the Fides Nicaena, which he dated 375—381, he regarded as resting
<span class="pb" id="page_290"><b class="pb">{Page 290}</b></span>
on a form of the Teaching which lacked 1.3b—2.1, but was not confined
to the Two Ways material alone.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn_2">2</a></sup> These documents may be consulted
in Migne, <i>Patrologia Graeca</i>, 28, col. 835 f. and 1637 f. It is
true the form of the Teaching which they reflect lacked 1.3b—2.1,
but I find no trace of Didache 7—16 in either of them, except the
casual reference to Wednesday and Friday as the regular Christian fast
days. But it did not require the Didache to tell the writer this; he and
all his readers must have been familiar with the church practice about
fast days; and his neglect of all the rest that Didache 7—16 had to offer
is clear evidence that he did not have it. The Fides seems to be largely
based upon the Summary, much of which it repeats, often with modifications.</p>

<p>Of the 161 items we have listed in the Doctrina, about twenty-six
can be easily identified in the Syntagma and the same twenty-six
reappear in the Fides. There is here hardly a detail that could be
credited to Didache 1—6 that is not also found in Doctrina, and this
trifling variation may be due to the fourth-century writers’ familiarity
with the New Testament, the language of which both occasionally
appropriate. Certainly it is the Greek form of the Doctrina, not the
Greek Didache, that is reflected in both Syntagma and Fides, and
probably the compiler of the Fides got his Doctrina materials from
the Syntagma. Yet this is not certain, for sometimes Fides’ form is
the more original.</p>

<p>The Doctrina items that are identifiable in Syntagma are 10, 11, 16,
15, 19, 18, 20, 29, 28, 31, (49), 55, 127, 20, 21, 46, 32, 38, 77, 90,
59, 60, 34, 95, 96, 153, 154. Fides has these in the same order, with
few deviations.</p>

<p>The evidence of Syntagma and Fides then points to the use, direct
or indirect, of the Greek Doctrina, not the Greek Didache, in their
composition, and they may be added to the four documents already
listed, as showing its unmistakable use. Indeed, it has now become
clear that, while the considerable use of Didache’s materials in other
Christian writings seems to be confined to the Didascalia, late in the
third century, and the Apostolic Constitutions, late in the fourth, that
of Doctrina can be traced in Didache, Barnabas, the Apostolic Church
Ordinances, the Summary of Doctrine, the Fides Nicaena, and the Life
<span class="pb" id="page_291"><b class="pb">{Page 291}</b></span>
of Schnudi. The evidence for its literary influence is much greater than
is that for the influence of Didache.</p>

<p>If we now look back to the theory of the origin of Didache given
by some scholars—that Barnabas as a source supplied the Two
Ways material to Didache, and that the Doctrina played no part in the
development of the subsequent kindred literature, Schnudi, Church
Ordinances, Summary of Doctrine, Fides Nicaena, Didascalia, Apostolic
Constitutions—their theory seems to be shattered by the fact that
the Life of Schnudi, the Apostolic Church Ordinances and the Summary
of Doctrine agree in neglecting two-thirds of Didache, and the
same two-thirds: that is, they make no use of 1.3b—2.1 and 6.3-16.8.
The natural explanation of this is that they made use not of Didache
but of a Greek document lacking just these parts; and just such a
document the Greek text lying back of Doctrina would provide.</p>

<p>Neither Didache, Barnabas, nor Schnudi contains all the 161
phrases, clauses, or words into which Doctrina (omitting the trinitarian
formula at the close) may be divided.</p>

<p>Eight scattered items are present in both Didache and Barnabas
but are not recognizable in Doctrina:</p>

<p>You shall not show partiality in reproving for transgressions.<br/>
You must not forsake the commands of the Lord.<br/>
Duplicity.<br/>
Fraud.<br/>
You shall confess your sins.<br/>
Advocates of the rich (though Doctrina 151 may be a corruption of
this and the following).<br/>
Unjust judges of the poor.<br/>
Utterly sinful.</p>

<p>The last three are especially striking as they form a sequence in both
Didache and Barnabas.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 94 items are common to all three writings,
Didache, Barnabas, and Doctrina; 145 appear in both Didache and
Doctrina, and 104 in both Barnabas and Doctrina. Even in the abbreviated
form of it in the Life of Schnudi, 77 parallels can be found.
These are almost exactly the proportions in which Mark was reproduced
in Matthew (90 to 95 per cent) and in Luke (about 60 per
<span class="pb" id="page_292"><b class="pb">{Page 292}</b></span>
cent). Just 90 per cent of Doctrina appears in Didache, and about 60
per cent of it can be recognized in Barnabas. This only shows that
there is nothing strange in Didache’s using more of Doctrina and
Barnabas less. Such were the literary habits of the early church.</p>

<p>A few items are present in Barnabas and Doctrina, but not in Didache:
(the ways) of Light and Darkness; angel guards set over them;
and a larger number in Didache and Doctrina but not in Barnabas:
Life and Death; and most strikingly items 39—56 in one block.</p>

<p>The common material appears in Didache in very much the same
order as in Doctrina, but in Barnabas it is very differently arranged,
being naturally and properly recast and reduced, since it is to form
just an appendix—a cauda—to a larger work in a more ambitious key.</p>

<p>But is Doctrina the source of the other two, and did Didache take
over about 90 per cent of its material, interpolating it with material
from Matthew 5 and Luke 6, as well as I Peter and Hermas, while
Barnabas took over almost 60 per cent of it, rearranging it and adding
to it here and there? There is much to encourage this view, but the
presence of eight substantial items in both Didache and Barnabas
which are not in Doctrina is almost fatal to it.</p>

<p>But Doctrina is not an original Greek text but a Latin translation of
one, made of course long after the Greek document which it translated
was written. Can that Greek document have been the original source
of the long artless string of moral injunctions that appear in all
three? We should then have to suppose that the eight items (5
per cent of the whole) were lost either from the Greek original before
it was translated, or lost in making the translation. The generally
detached character of the style may be said to favour this, and the
tendency toward omission on the part of ancient scribes is well known.
Clark claimed that the transmission of an ancient Greek or Latin text
is like the experience of a traveller who leaves a piece of luggage behind
every time he changes trains.</p>

<p>This is the probable solution of the problem, and it does not call
for the postulating of any imaginary source, for of course Doctrina is
a translation of a (lost) Greek document; it is that lost Greek document,
certified by the existence of the Latin version of it, the Doctrina,
on which first the writer of Didache and then the editor of the second
edition of Barnabas drew; Didache was a second edition of it.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_293"><b class="pb">{Page 293}</b></span></p>

<p>Both the Teaching of the Apostles and the Letter of Barnabas, in
short, underwent expansion. The Teaching was originally simply the
original Greek form of Doctrina. After a generation of usefulness it
was expanded into the church manual we know as the Didache. Much
of it was also embodied in the second edition of Barnabas, soon after
A.D. 150, in the Apostolic Church Ordinances, ca. 300, in the Summary
of Doctrine, 350-370, the Fides Nicaena, 375-381, and the Coptic
Life of Schnudi. The fuller Greek Didache itself was in time worked
into the Didascalia, 250-300, and the Apostolic Constitutions, about
380.</p>

<p>Barnabas, chapters 1-17, was written about A.D. 130, and a generation
later was enlarged by the addition of about 60 per cent of the
Greek original of the Doctrina. But the first edition of Barnabas continued
to circulate, for it was later translated into Latin, without any
such additions.</p>

<p>A closer examination of Barnabas’ great omission, Doctrina, clauses
39—56, shows that much of it—murder, lust, enchantment, magic,
lying, avarice, grumbling—are covered elsewhere in Barnabas, Chapters 18-21,
mostly in <i>positive</i> command, adjusted to a loftier plane of
Christian living: Be simple (straightforward) in heart and rich in spirit;
As far as you can, you shall be pure. Anger, murder, enchantment,
magic, and grumbling are covered either generally or specifically in
Barnabas 19.3—11. It is a mistake to suppose Didache superior to
Barnabas in its presentation of the Two Ways material; Didache is in
fact inferior, for it contains some repetitions which Barnabas strips off.
That is, Didache <i>copies</i> the Greek original of Doctrina, Barnabas <i>rewrites</i>
it. Moreover, Barnabas presents not so much vices to be shunned
as virtues to be cultivated, a far superior method, of course. The average
Christian then as now does not so much need to be told not to
murder, rob, lust, or lie as to be kind, generous, pure and true. The
editor who added the Two Ways material to Barnabas perceived this.
He was not writing to “the heathen” but to a public so familiar with
the Jewish scriptures that they would enjoy the allegories of Barnabas
1—17, and naturally so advanced in the Christian life that some rudimentary
morals might be taken for granted.</p>

<p>The way of life and the way of death as moral alternatives go back
at least as far as Jer. 21:8, “I set before you the way of life and the
<span class="pb" id="page_294"><b class="pb">{Page 294}</b></span>
way of death,” with which we may compare Deut. 30:15, Ps. 1:6 and
16:11, Testament of Asher 1:3-5, and Enoch, ch. 91; but Matt. 7:13
was probably better known to the writer of the original Didache. In
fact, first-century Christian literature is constantly echoed in it, a point
lost sight of by those who would explain it as a work of Jewish origin.</p>

<p>The most difficult resemblance between Didache and Doctrina to
explain is Doctrina 1.94, “For the Lord wishes to give of his gifts to
all.” Didache 1.4 reads, “For the Father wishes that it be given of his
own gifts (Gr. <i>charismatôn</i>) to all.” But in Didache this occurs in the
midst of what is clearly an appropriation from Hermas, Commandment
ii.4-6, where it reads, “For God wishes that it be given of his own
(Gr. <i>dôrêmatôn</i>) to all.” The solution probably is that the compiler of
Didache in making up his mosaic from Matt. 5, Luke 6, I Peter,
and Hermas, Command ii.4-6, took this line over with its context
from Hermas, and then when he came to the same line in his Two
Ways source, 1.94, naturally omitted it. Perhaps its occurrence in his
Two Ways source recalled its fuller expression in Hermas. As between
Hermas and the Greek lying behind Doctrina, the Greek Doctrina
probably derived the saying from Hermas, unless both obtained it
from some source unknown to us.</p>

<p>To recapitulate: of the 161 items in Doctrina 77 can be recognized
in the Life of Schnudi; 94 in both Didache and Barnabas; 104 in
Barnabas; 145 in Didache; and 149 in Didache and Barnabas taken together.
The bearing of these figures is unmistakable; Doctrina closely
approximates the source of all three of the other documents. It is
reasonable to suppose that the original Greek of Doctrina was the
source of all the others, as well as of the Summary of Doctrine and
the Fides Nicaena. Doctrina is not a Latin version of Didache 1-6, as
modern patristic writers carelessly assume. Nor can these relationships
be reversed, so as to make Barnabas the source of Didache and
Doctrina, or Didache the source of Barnabas and Doctrina.</p>

<p>The prevalent confusion as to the relations of Doctrina, Didache,
and Barnabas can probably be somewhat relieved by a conspectus of
their parallel portions, with some line numbers to guide the reader to
actual parallels. I have made the Latin Doctrina our base, numbering
its lines in fives, in the old textbook manner; putting after each line
of the others the number of the parallel line in Doctrina.</p>

<p><span class="pb" id="page_295"><b class="pb">{Page 295}</b></span></p>

<p>It is here reprinted, with much of the preceding argument, with the
editor’s permission from the <i>Anglican Theological Review</i>, XXVIII
(1945), pp. 228-247. So much of the text reappears in the Life of
Schnudi that I have included the pertinent parts of it, but not its continuous
text. Opinions may differ as to the closeness of some of these
parallels, but not so much, I think, as to affect the general conclusion,
that the Greek document of which Doctrina is a translation is the basic
Two Ways underlying all six—Didache, Barnabas, Church Ordinances,
Summary of Doctrine, Fides Nicaena, and Life of Schnudi; and,
through the Didache, influencing also the Didascalia and the Apostolic

<i>The Origin of the New Testament</i>, p. 114. M. Omont of the Bibliothèque
Nationale was kind enough years ago to provide me with a photograph of
the pages of Claromontanus containing the list, so that I might determine
with certainty its actual contents.</p>

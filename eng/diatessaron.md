# Diatessaron

The Diatessaron is an early harmony of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John that was produced by Tatian of Syria. The original (presumably Greek) text of Tatian's harmony has not survived. The translations into English below are from possible translations of Tatian's harmony into other languages (Arabic, Latin, Dutch and Middle English). The connections between all of these translations and Tatian's harmony or some other early Christian harmony is speculative. Very possibly all of these may be remnants of other early harmonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, rather than translations of Tatian's harmony.

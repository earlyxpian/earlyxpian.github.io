# Ante-Nicene Fathers (ANF)

This 10 volume set was published between 1885 and 1897. A. Cleveland Coxe was the editor and most of the material was taken from the previously published [Ante-Nicene Christian Library](ancl.html). The translations in this volume are dated and the language is sometimes complex but the translation is fairly literal. With the notable exception of much of Origen's writings (which are extensive) most of the surviving writings of the pre-Nicene Christians are contained in this collection. The collection also includes writings which are probably post-Nicene or even forgeries if they are considered of sufficient historical interest.

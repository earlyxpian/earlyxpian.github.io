# The Odes of Solomon: A Selection Rendered Into English Verse

This small book contains translations of some of the [*Odes of Solomon*](odesofsolomon.html) with signficiant reworking of the English to set the words to rhyme and meter and, according to the author, with "here and there a thought changed where the sentiment was unsuitable or the allusion obscure". The translation was done by Sherburne Povah Tregelles (S.P.T.) Prideaux and published in 1927 by The Society for for Promoting Christian Knowledge (S.P.C.K.). This material was originally published in four journal articles in the journal *Theology* in 1924-1926. Prideaux died in 1956 and therefore his writings are in the public domain in Canada and any other countries with a copyright term of 50 years after the death of the author. In the U.S.A. this work should enter the public domain in 2023. In most of the rest of the world, this work should enter into the public domain in 2026/2027.

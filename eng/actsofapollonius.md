# Acts of Apollonius

## Brief description:

This writing appears to be an eye-witness account of the trial of Apollonius in Rome during the reign of Commodus (180-192 A.D.). Eusebius (writing in the early forth century) says that Apollonius was "a Christian celebrated for his faith and learning" and that the judge asked him to provide an account of himself in the Senate. Jerome (writing in the late fourth century) claims that he was a Roman senator, although nothing in this account suggests this.

The account survives in a Greek text and an Armenian text.

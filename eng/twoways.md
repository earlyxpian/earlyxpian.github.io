title: The Two Ways (English translations)

# The Two Ways (also known as *The Teaching* or *The Teaching of the Apostles*)

*The Two Ways* is very likely the oldest early Christian writing outside of the New Testament. It was possibly written before some of the later books of the New Testament.  It is a description of the way of life and the way of death. It has survived in three forms: 1. it is the first part of the document which has come to be known as [*The Didache*](didache.html); 2. it is contained in the last part of [*The Letter of Barnabas*](barnabas.html); 3. it exists on its own in a Latin version which is probably a translation from Greek.

To read English translations the first two versions of *The Two Ways*, see the links above. To read an English translation of the Latin verion, see [*The Apostolic Fathers: An American Translation*](goodspeedapostolicfathers.html). This book by Edgar J. Goodspeed contains a comparision of the three forms of *The Two Ways*.

# Tertullian

Tertuallian's surviving writings are extensive. [The Tertullain Project](http://www.tertullian.org/) already has a large amount of information about his writings along with lists of available translations. That information will not be duplicated here.

Tertullian's "Apology" is probably his most important work. A translation of that work not available at The Tertullian Project is available here:

* Gerald H. Rendall/W. C. A. Kerr (translated ~1930)
  * ["Tertullian and Marcus Minucius Felix"](https://archive.org/details/L250TertullianApologyMarcusMinuciusFelixDeSpectaculisOctavius), Volume 250 of the "Loeb Classical Library" (published 1930) --- facsimile

This collection of the accounts of early Christian martyrdoms was edited and translated by Edward Charles Everard Owen. It was published in 1927 by The Clarendon Press. There are extensive notes on each account.

E. C. E. Owen died in 1949 and therefore his writings are public domain in any country where works pass into the public domain 70 or fewer years after the death of the author (this includes most countries in the world). In the U.S.A., this work entered the public domain in 2023.

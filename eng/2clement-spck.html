<p class="P38">PREFACE</p>
<p class="P38">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="P38">This treatise, traditionally ascribed to St. Clement
of Rome, is in reality a second-century sermon by an unknown
author. &nbsp;Possibly the writer’s name was Clement—it was a
common name among Christians—but more probably the sermon was
preserved in the archives of the Church of Corinth with the genuine
epistle of Clement to that Church, and the two writings were copied
into the same manuscript, and were later ascribed to the same
author. &nbsp;That Corinth was the place of origin is probable from
chap. vii., where the Isthmian games seem to be mentioned from the
point of view of one dwelling on the spot. &nbsp;The date cannot be
definitely fixed, but was probably A.D. 130-150.</p>
<p class="P38">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="P38">We read the little treatise with great interest,
since it is the earliest extant Christian sermon. &nbsp;Modern
scholars generally dismiss it as a feeble production, containing
nothing but pious platitudes. &nbsp;Most modern sermons would be
similarly condemned if judged by the same standards. &nbsp;Scholars
are included to be severe on a document which, being quite
uncontroversial, throws no light on the problems which interest
them. &nbsp;Judged by other standards it is an excellent
sermon—simple, earnest, and all the better for being
uncontroversial; it was evidently preserved because of its merits.
&nbsp;Readers who look up the references can form their own
conclusions as to the authority of the New Testament at the time.
&nbsp;Clearly the canon was far from fixed, <span class="T21">or
there would be proportionately fewer quotations from uncanonical
writings. &nbsp;The doctrine of Christ’s Person is very
high.</span></p>

Secretary of the S.P.C.K. as a companion to the Greek text provided

<p class="P36">SECOND EPISTLE OF CLEMENT TO THE CORINTHIANS</p>
<p class="P1">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P1">I. Brethren, we must think of Jesus Christ as of
God, as of the Judge of quick and dead<span class=
"Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: I. 1. Acts 10:42"><a href=
"#ftn1" id="body_ftn1" name="body_ftn1">1</a></span>, and we must
not think little of our salvation. &nbsp;2. For when we think
little of Him it is little indeed that we may hope to obtain.
&nbsp;And those who listen as though it were about little things
sin, and we also sin if we do not know out of what and by Whom and
to what place we were called, and how many things Jesus Christ
endured to suffer for our sake. &nbsp;3. What return, then, shall
we make to Him, or what fruit shall we give worthy of His gift to
us? &nbsp;And how great a debt of piety do we owe Him! &nbsp;4. For
He gave us the light; as a Father He called us sons. He saved us
when we were perishing. &nbsp;5. What praise, then shall we give
Him, or what reward for the benefits which we received? &nbsp;6. We
were blind in our understanding, worshipping stones and stocks and
gold and silver and copper, the works of men, and our whole life
was nothing else than death. Enveloped with darkness, and with our
eyes full of <span class="T1">such mist, we yet</span> <span class=
"T1">recovered our sight, and by His will cast off the cloud which
enveloped us. &nbsp;7. For He had mercy on us, and in His
compassion He saved us, seeing great error and destruction in us,
and our hopelessness of salvation, unless that which comes from
Him. &nbsp;8. For He called us when we were not, and willed that
out of nothing we should come to being</span><span class=
"T1 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: I. 8. 1 Cor. 1:28"><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2" name=
"body_ftn2">2</a></span><span class="T1">.</span></div>
<p class="P1">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P2">II. “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for many more are the
children of the desolate than of her which hath the
husband.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: II. 1. Isa. 54:1; Gal. 4:27"><a href="#ftn3" id=
"body_ftn3" name="body_ftn3">3</a></span> &nbsp;When He said,
“Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not,” He spake of us, for our
Church was barren before children were given her. &nbsp;2. And when
He said, “Cry, thou that travailest not,” He means this, that we
should offer our prayers in sincerity to God, and not <span class=
"T15">faint</span> like women in travail. &nbsp;3. And when He
said, “For the children of the desolate are many more than of her
which hath a husband,” He meant that our people seemed to be
desolate and deserted by God; &nbsp;but now, having believed, we
have become more than those who seemed to have God. &nbsp;4. Again,
another Scripture says: “I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: II. 4. Matt. 9:13; Mark 2:17; Luke 5:32"><a href="#ftn4"
id="body_ftn4" name="body_ftn4">4</a></span> 5. He means that it is
necessary to save the perishing. &nbsp;6. For this is great and
wonderful, to establish not the things which are standing, but
those which are <span class="T2">falling. &nbsp;7. So also Christ
willed to save the things that were perishing, and He saved many
men, coming and calling us when we were already
perishing</span><span class="T2 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: II. 7. Luke 19:10"><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5" name=
"body_ftn5">5</a></span><span class="T2">.</span></div>
<p class="P2">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P3">III. Seeing, then, that He has bestowed such mercy
upon us, in the first place that we who are living do not sacrifice
to the dead gods, nor worship them, but through Him know the Father
of Truth, what is true knowledge as regards Him except that we
should not deny Him through Whom we knew the Father? &nbsp;2. Now
He Himself says: “He that confessed Me before men, I will confess
him before My Father.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: III. 2. Matt. 10:32; Luke 12:8"><a href="#ftn6" id=
"body_ftn6" name="body_ftn6">6</a></span> &nbsp;3. This, then, is
our reward if we confess Him through Whom we were saved. &nbsp;4.
But in what way do we confess Him? &nbsp;By doing what He says, and
not disobeying His commandments, and honouring Him not only with
our lips, but “with all our heart and all our mind.”<span class=
"Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: III. 4. Mark 12:30"><a href=
"#ftn7" id="body_ftn7" name="body_ftn7">7</a></span> &nbsp;5. And
He says also in Isaiah: “This people honoureth Me with their lips,
but their heart is far from Me.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor"
title="Footnote: III. 5. Isa. 23:13; Matt. 15:8; Mark 7:6"><a href=
"#ftn8" id="body_ftn8" name="body_ftn8">8</a></span></div>
<p class="P3">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P3">IV. Let us, then, not <span class="T3">only call
Him Lord, for this will not save us. &nbsp;2. For He says: “Not
every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he
that doeth righteousness.”</span><span class=
"T3 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: IV. 2. Matt. 7:21"><a href="#ftn9" id="body_ftn9" name=
"body_ftn9">9</a></span> <span class="T3">&nbsp;3. So then,
brethren, let us confess Him in our works by loving one another,
but not committing adultery, nor speaking one against another, nor
being envious, but by being self-controlled, merciful, good;
&nbsp;and we ought to sympathise with one another, and not be
covetous. &nbsp;By these works we confess Him, and not by the
opposite kind. &nbsp;4. And we must not fear men rather than God.
&nbsp;5. For this reason, if ye do these things, the Lord said: “If
ye be gathered together with Me in My bosom, and do not My
commandments, I will cast you out, and will say to you, Depart from
Me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of
iniquity.”</span><span class="T3 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: IV. 5. The source of the quotation is unknown; the last clause is found in Luke 13:27."><a href="#ftn10"
id="body_ftn10" name="body_ftn10">10</a></span></div>
<p class="P3">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P4">V. Wherefore, brethren, let us forsake our
sojourning in this world, and let us do the will of Him Who called
us, and not be afraid to depart out of this world. &nbsp;2. For the
Lord said: “Ye shall be as lambs in the midst of wolves.” &nbsp;3.
And Peter answered and said to Him: “What if the wolves should tear
the lambs?” &nbsp;4. Jesus said to Peter: “The lambs need not fear
the wolves after they are dead; and so with you—fear not those that
slay you, and can do nothing more to you; &nbsp;but fear Him who
after your death hath power over body and soul, to cast them into
the gehenna of fire.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: V. 2-4. Source unknown."><a href="#ftn11" id=
"body_ftn11" name="body_ftn11">11</a></span> &nbsp;5. And know,
brethren, that the sojourning in this world of our flesh is short
and transitory, but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful,
and means the rest of the kingdom which is to come and eternal
life. &nbsp;6. What, then, <span class="T16">s</span>hall we do to
obtain these things, save walk in holiness and righteousness, and
regard these worldly things as <span class="T4">alien to us, and
not desire them? &nbsp;7. For when we desire to win these things we
fall from the righteous path.</span></div>
<p class="P4">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P5">VI. &nbsp;The Lord says: “No servant can serve two
masters.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: VI. 1. Matt. 6:24; Luke 16:13"><a href="#ftn12" id=
"body_ftn12" name="body_ftn12">12</a></span> &nbsp;If we desire to
serve both God and mammon it is unprofitable to us. &nbsp;2. “For
what advantage is it if a man gain the whole world and forfeit his
soul?”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: VI. 2. Matt. 16:26; Mark 8:36; Luke 9:25"><a href=
"#ftn13" id="body_ftn13" name="body_ftn13">13</a></span> &nbsp;3.
Now this world and the world to come are two enemies. &nbsp; 4.
This world spells adultery and corruption and deceit, but that
world bids these things farewell. &nbsp;5. We cannot, then be
friends of the two; but we must bid farewell to this world and use
the other. &nbsp;6. Let us reckon that it is better to hate the
things which are here, for they are little and transitory and
corruptible, and to love the things there, which are good and
incorruptible. &nbsp;7. For if we do the will of Christ we shall
find rest; otherwise nothing shall deliver us from eternal
punishment, if we neglect His commandments. &nbsp;8. And the
Scripture also says, in Ezekiel, that “though Noah and Job and
Daniel arise, they shall not deliver their children in the
captivity.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: VI. 8. Ezek. 14:14,18,20"><a href="#ftn14" id=
"body_ftn14" name="body_ftn14">14</a></span> &nbsp;9. But if even
such righteous men cannot deliver their children by their own
righteous acts, with what confidence shall we enter into the palace
of God, if we keep not our baptism pure and undefiled? &nbsp;Or who
shall be our advocate if we be not found having holy and righteous
works?</div>
<p class="P5">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P6">VII. So, then, my brethren, let us contend, knowing
that the contest is close at hand, and that many di<span class=
"T17">s</span>embark to take part in corruptible contests, but not
all are crowned—only those who have toiled much and contended well.
&nbsp;2. Let us then contend that we may all be crowned. &nbsp;3.
So let us run the straight course, the incorruptible contest, and
let many of us disembark to take part in it, and contend, that we
may also be crowned; and if we cannot all be crowned, let us at
least come near to the crown. 4. We must know that he who contends
in the corruptible contest, if he be found dealing corruptly, is
flogged, taken away, and thrown off the course. &nbsp;5. What do
you think? &nbsp;What shall he suffer who deals corruptly in the
contest of the incorruption? &nbsp;6. For of those who have not
kep<span class="T18">t</span> the seal it says: “Their worm shall
not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a
spectacle for all flesh.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: VII. 6. Isa. 66:24; Mark 9:44,46,48. the seal, i.e. of baptism."><a href="#ftn15"
id="body_ftn15" name="body_ftn15">15</a></span></div>
<p class="P6">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P6">VIII. Let us repent, then while we are on earth.
&nbsp;2. For we are clay for the hand of the craftsman; for just as
the potter, if he is making a vessel, and it be bent or broken in
his hands, reshapes it; but i<span class="T18">f</span> he has got
so far as to put it into the fiery oven, cannot help it any more;
so also let us, so long as we are in this world, repent with all
our heart of the evil things which we have done in the flesh, that
we may be saved by the Lord, while we have time for repentance.
&nbsp;3. For after we have departed from this world, we
<span class="T6">can no longer make confession there, or repent any
more. &nbsp;4. So then, brethren, if we do the will of the Father,
and preserve the flesh pure, and keep the commandments of the Lord,
we shall obtain eternal life. &nbsp;5. For the Lord says in the
Gospel: “If ye kept not that which is little, who shall give you
that which is great? &nbsp;For I tell you that he who is faithful
in the least, is faithful also in much.”</span><span class=
"T6 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: VIII. 5. Luke 16:10-12"><a href="#ftn16" id="body_ftn16"
name="body_ftn16">16</a></span> <span class="T6">&nbsp;6. So, then,
he means this: Keep the flesh pure, and the seal undefiled, that we
may obtain life.</span></div>
<p class="P6">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P7">IX. And let none of you say that this flesh is not
judged, and does not even rise again. &nbsp;2. Understand: in what
state were ye saved; in what did you receive your sight, except in
this flesh? &nbsp;3. We must therefore guard the flesh as a temple
of God. &nbsp;4. For like as you were called in the flesh, you
shall also come in the flesh. &nbsp;5. If Christ the Lord, Who
saved us, being first spirit, became flesh and so called us, so
also we shall receive our reward in this flesh. &nbsp;6. Let us
then love one another, that we may all come to the Kingdom of God.
&nbsp;7. While we have time to be healed, let us give ourselves to
God, Who heals us, giving Him recompense. &nbsp;8. What recompense?
Repentance from a sincere heart. &nbsp;9. For He has foreknowledge
of all things, and knows what is in our hearts. &nbsp;10. Let us
then give Him eternal praise, not only with the mouth, but also
from the heart, that He may receive us as sons. &nbsp;11. For the
Lord <span class="T7">said: “My brethren are these who do the will
of My Father.”</span><span class="T7 Footnote_20_anchor" title=

<div class="P8">X. Wherefore, my brethren, let us do the will of
the Father Who called us, that we may live, and let us rather
pursue virtue, and give up vice as the forerunner of our sins, and
let us flee from impiety lest evils overtake us. &nbsp;2. For if we
are diligent to do good, peace will pursue us. &nbsp;3. For this
cause it is not possible for a man to find it...when they bring in
human fears and prefer present enjoyment to the promise which is to
come<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: X. 3. The text is probably corrupt."><a href="#ftn18"
id="body_ftn18" name="body_ftn18">18</a></span>. &nbsp;4. For they
know not what great torment present enjoyment brings, and what is
the joy of the promised future. &nbsp;5. And if they did these
things by themselves it would be tolerable, but, as it is, they
continue to teach evil to guiltless souls, not knowing that they
will have double condemnation, both they and their hearers.</div>
<p class="P8">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P8">XI. Let us, then, serve God with a pure heart and
we shall be righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we do
not believe the promise of God, we shall be wretched. &nbsp;2. For
the word of prophecy also says: “Wretched are the double-minded,
who doubt in their hearts and say, All these things we heard we
heard even in our fathers’ time, yet we have waited day after day,
and have seen none of them. &nbsp;3. Ye foolish ones, compare
yourselves to a tree. &nbsp;Take a vine; first it sheds its leaves,
then there comes a <span class="T8">shoot, after this the grape,
then the ripe grape. &nbsp;4. So also my people had tumults and
afflictions, afterwards it shall receive good
things.”</span><span class="T8 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XI. 2-4. Quoted as Scripture in 1 Clem. 23:3,4, source unknown."><a href="#ftn19"
id="body_ftn19" name="body_ftn19">19</a></span> <span class=
"T8">&nbsp;5. Wherefore, my brethren, let us not be double-minded,
but let us endure in hope, that we may also receive the reward.
&nbsp;6. “For he is faithful that promised”</span><span class=
"T8 Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: XI. 6. Heb 10:23"><a href=
"#ftn20" id="body_ftn20" name="body_ftn20">20</a></span>
<span class="T8">to pay to each man the recompense of his deeds.
&nbsp;7. If, then, we do righteousness before God, we shall enter
into His Kingdom and receive the promises “which ear hath not
heard, nor eye seen, nor hath it entered into the heart of
man.”</span><span class="T8 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XI. 7. 1 Cor. 2:9"><a href="#ftn21" id="body_ftn21"
name="body_ftn21">21</a></span></div>
<p class="P8">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P9">XII. Let us then await the Kingdom of God hourly in
love and righteousness, since we know not the day of God’s
appearing. &nbsp;2. For the Lord Himself, asked by someone when His
Kingdom would come, said: “When the two shall be one, and the
outside as the inside, and the male with the female neither male
nor female.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XII. 2. This saying is found, according to Clement of Alexandria, in the Gospel of the Egyptians; it is also in the Oxyrhyneus papyri."><a href="#ftn22"
id="body_ftn22" name="body_ftn22">22</a></span> &nbsp;3. Now “the
two are one” when we speak to one another in truth, and there is
one soul in two bodies without dissimulation. &nbsp;4. And “the
outside as the inside” means this: the inside means the soul and
the outside the body. &nbsp;In like manner, therefore, as thy body
is visible, so let thy soul be manifest in good works. &nbsp;5. And
“the male with the female neither male nor female,” means that a
brother seeing a sister should have no thought of her as female,
<span class="T9">not should she think of him as male. &nbsp;6. “If
ye do this,” He says, “the Kingdom of My Father shall
come.”</span></div>
<p class="P9">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P10">XIII. Therefore, brethren, now at last let us
repent and be sober unto the good, for we are full of much folly
and wickedness; let us wipe off from ourselves our former sins, and
by repentance from the soul win salvation. &nbsp;Let us not become
men-pleasers, nor desire to please by our righteousness ourselves
alone, but rather those also that are without, that the Name be not
blasphemed by reason of us. 2. For the Lord says, “Continually is
My name blasphemed among all the Gentiles”; and again, “Woe unto
him by reason of whom My name is blasphemed.”<span class=
"Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIII. 2. Isa. 52:5. The second quotation is unknown."><a href="#ftn23"
id="body_ftn23" name="body_ftn23">23</a></span> &nbsp;Wherein is it
blasphemed? &nbsp;In that you do not what I desire. &nbsp;3. For
when the Gentiles hear from our mouth the oracles of God, they
marvel at their beauty and greatness; afterwards, when they learn
that our works are unworthy of the words which we speak, they turn
from their attitude to blasphemy, saying that it is a myth and a
delusion. &nbsp;4. For when they hear from us that God says, “It is
no thank to you, if ye love them that love you, but it is thank to
you if ye love your enemies and them that hate you”<span class=
"Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIII. 4. Luke 6:32,35"><a href="#ftn24" id="body_ftn24"
name="body_ftn24">24</a></span>--when they hear this they wonder at
its extraordinary goodness; but when they see that not only do we
not love them that hate us, but not even those who love us, they
laugh at us, and the Name is blasphemed.</div>
<p class="P10">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P11">XIV. So, brethren, if we do the will of God our
Father, we shall be of the first Church, the spiritual one created
before the sun and moon; but if we do not the Lord’s will, we shall
be of the Scripture which saith, “My house was made a den of
robbers.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIV. 1. Jer. 7:11; Matt. 21:13"><a href="#ftn25" id=
"body_ftn25" name="body_ftn25">25</a></span> &nbsp;Let us therefore
choose to be of the Church of life, that we may be saved. &nbsp;2.
I suppose you are not ignorant that the living “Church is the body
of Christ”? &nbsp;For the Scripture saith, “God made man male and
female”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIV. 2. Eph. 1:23; Gen 1:27; 1 Pet. 1:20"><a href=
"#ftn26" id="body_ftn26" name="body_ftn26">26</a></span>; the male
is Christ and the female is the Church. &nbsp;And it is clear that
the books and the Apostles say that the Church is not of the
present but from the beginning; for she was spiritual, as was also
our Jesus, and He was manifested in the last days to save us.
&nbsp;3. And the Church, being spiritual, was manifested in the
flesh of Christ, showing us that if any of us guard her in the
flesh and corrupt her not, he shall receive her again in the Holy
Spirit. &nbsp;For this flesh is an antitype of the Spirit; no one,
therefore, who has corrupted the antitype shall receive the
original. &nbsp;So, then, it means this: Guard the flesh, that ye
may partake of the Spirit. &nbsp;4. But if we say that the flesh is
the Church and the Spirit is Christ, then he who has abused the
flesh has abused the Church. &nbsp;Such a one, therefore, will not
partake of the Spirit, which is Christ. &nbsp;5. So great is the
life and immortality which this flesh has the power to receive if
the Holy Spirit is <span class="T10">joined to it, nor can any man
utter or tell “the things which the Lord has
prepared”</span><span class="T10 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIV. 5. 1 Cor. 2:9"><a href="#ftn27" id="body_ftn27"
name="body_ftn27">27</a></span> <span class="T10">for His
elect.</span></div>
<p class="P11">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P12">XV. I think I have given no mean counsel
concerning self-control, and whoever follows it shall not repent,
but shall save both himself and me, his counsellor. &nbsp;For it is
no small reward to convert a wandering and perishing soul that it
may be saved. &nbsp;2. For we have this recompense to pay to God
our Creator, if he who speaks and hears both speaks and hears with
faith and love. &nbsp;3. Let us then abide in what we believed,
righteous and holy, that we may pray with confidence to God, Who
says: “While thou art yet speaking I will say, Behold, here am
I.”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XV. 3. Isa. 63:9"><a href="#ftn28" id="body_ftn28" name=
"body_ftn28">28</a></span> &nbsp;4. For this saying betokens a
great promise; for the Lord say<span class="T19">s</span> that He
is more ready to give than he that asketh to ask. &nbsp;5. Being,
then partakers of such great goodness, let us not grudge ourselves
the obtaining of such blessings. &nbsp;For great as is the delight
which these words bring to those who have done them, equally great
is the condemnation which they contain for the disobedient.</div>
<p class="P12">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P12">XVI. Wherefore, brethren, since we have received
no small opportunity for repentance, let us, whi<span class=
"T20">le</span> we have time, return to God Who called us, so long
as we still have One ready to receive us. &nbsp;2. For if we bid
farewell to these enjoyments and conquer our soul, by refusing to
do its evil lusts, we shall partake of the mercy of Jesus. &nbsp;3.
But ye know that “the day of judgment is already coming as a
burning oven and the powers of heaven shall melt,”<span class=
"Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XVI. 3. Mal. 6:1; Isa. 34:4"><a href="#ftn29" id=
"body_ftn29" name="body_ftn29">29</a></span> and the whole earth
shall be as lead melting in the fire, and then shall appear the
secret and open works of men. &nbsp;<span class="T11">4. Almsgiving
is therefore good, as is repentance for sin; fasting is better than
prayer, but almsgiving better than both; and love “covers a
multitude of sins,”</span><span class="T11 Footnote_20_anchor"
title="Footnote: XVI. 4. Prov 10:12; 1 Pet. 4:8"><a href="#ftn30"
id="body_ftn30" name="body_ftn30">30</a></span> <span class=
"T11">but prayer out of a good conscience delivers from death.
&nbsp;Blessed is every man who is found full of them; for
almsgiving lightens the burden of sin.</span></div>
<p class="P12">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P13">XVII. Let us then repent with our whole heart,
lest any of us perish by the way. &nbsp;For if we have commandments
to do this also, to drag men away from idols and instruct them, how
much more is it necessary that a soul which already knows God
should not perish? &nbsp;2. Let us then help one another, and lead
on those that are weak as regards goodness, that we may all be
saved, and convert and admonish one another. &nbsp;3. And let us
not only seem now to attend and believe while we are admonished by
the presbyters, but also when we have gone home let us remember the
Lord’s commandments and not be dragged the other way by worldly
lusts; rather let us attend more frequently, and try to advance in
the commandments of the Lords, that “all having the same
mind,”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XVII. 3. Rom. 12:16; Phil. 2:2"><a href="#ftn31" id=
"body_ftn31" name="body_ftn31">31</a></span> our gathering together
may be unto life. &nbsp;4. For the Lord said: “I come to gather
together all the nations, tribes, and languages.”<span class=
"Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: XVII. 4. Isa. 66:18"><a href=
"#ftn32" id="body_ftn32" name="body_ftn32">32</a></span> &nbsp;By
this He <span class="T12">means the day of His appearing, when He
will come and redeem us, each according to his works. &nbsp;5. And
the unbelievers “shall see His glory” and might, and shall be
amazed when they see the palace of the world in the hands of Jesus,
and shall say: “Woe unto us, for it was Thou, and we knew not and
did not believe, and were disobedient to the presbyters who told us
of our salvation. &nbsp;And “their worm shall not die, and their
fire shall not quenched, and they shall be a spectacle to all
flesh.”</span><span class="T12 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XVII. 5. Isa. 66:18,24"><a href="#ftn33" id="body_ftn33"
name="body_ftn33">33</a></span> <span class="T12">&nbsp;6. He is
speaking of that day of judgment, when they shall see those that
lived impiously in our midst and perverted the commandments of
Jesus Christ. &nbsp;7. But the righteous, who have done good, and
endured torments and hated the pleasures of the soul, when they see
those who have done amiss and denied Jesus by their words or their
deeds, how they are punished by terrible torments in unquenchable
fire, shall be giving “glory to their God,” saying: “There shall be
hope for him who has served God with all his
heart.”</span><span class="T12 Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XVII. 7. Rev. 11:13"><a href="#ftn34" id="body_ftn34"
name="body_ftn34">34</a></span></div>
<p class="P13">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="P14">XVIII. Let us also be of the number of those who
give thanks, who have served God, and not of the impious who are
judged. &nbsp;2. For I myself also am altogether sinful, and have
not yet escaped temptation, but being still surrounded by the
engines of the Devil, I strive to follow after righteousness, that
I may be strong enough at least to come near it, fearing the
judgment to come.</p>
<p class="P14">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="P15">XIX. &nbsp;Therefore, brothers and sisters, after
ye have heard the God of Truth, I am reading you a petition that ye
heed what is written, that ye may save both yourselves and him who
reads<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIX. 1. Him who reads. The author is possibly only in minor orders, as a “reader.”"><a href="#ftn35"
id="body_ftn35" name="body_ftn35">35</a></span> among you.
&nbsp;For as my reward, I beseech you to repent with all your
heart, giving yourselves salvation and life. &nbsp;For by doing
this we shall set up a mark for all the young who wish to work in
the cause of piety and the goodness of God. &nbsp;2. And let us not
be foolishly vexed or angry when anyone admonishes us and turns us
from unrighteousness to righteousness. &nbsp;For sometimes when we
do evil we perceive it not because of the double-mindedness and
unbelief within our breasts, and we are “darkened in our
understanding”<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title=
"Footnote: XIX. 2. Eph. 4:18"><a href="#ftn36" id="body_ftn36"
name="body_ftn36">36</a></span> by vain lusts. &nbsp;3. Let us then
do righteousness, that we may be saved at the end. &nbsp;Blessed
are they who obey these commands; though for a little time they
suffer in this world, they shall gather the immortal fruit of the
resurrection. &nbsp;4. Let not, then, the religious man grieve if
he be miserable in these present times. &nbsp;A time of blessedness
awaits him; he shall live again above with the Fathers, and rejoice
in an eternity without sorrow.</div>
<p class="P15">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="P15">XX. But neither let his disturb your mind, that we
see the unrighteous wealthy and the servants of &nbsp;God
straitened. &nbsp;2. Let us have faith, then, brother and sisters;
we are contending in the contest of the living God, and are being
trained in this present life <span class="T13">that we may be
crowned in the life to come. &nbsp;3. None of the righteous attains
a reward quickly, but he waits for it. &nbsp;4. For if God had been
wont to pay the reward of the righteous quickly, we should at once
have been training in commerce and not in godliness; for we should
have seemed to be righteous when we were pursuing not piety, but
gain. &nbsp;And for this reason Divine judgment punishes a spirit
which is not righteous and loads it with chains.</span></p>
<div class="P16">5. To the only God, invisible, Father of Truth,
Who sent us the Saviour and Prince of Immortality, through Whom
also He manifested to us the truth and the heavenly life, to Him be
glory for ever and ever. &nbsp;Amen.<span class=

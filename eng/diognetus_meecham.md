# The Epistle to Diognetus: The Greek Text with Introduction, Translation, and Notes

This critical text of the letter of Mathetes to Diognetus with extensive notes and an English translation was edited by Henry George Meecham and published in 1949. Henry G. Meecham died in 1955 and therefore his writings are in the public domain in Canada and any other country where copyrights extend 50 years after the death of the author. In most other countries (other than the U.S.), this work should enter the public domain in 2025/2026.

# Letter of Barnabas

This letter, written to an unknown group of Christians, is considered by many to be anonymous because the text of the letter does not contain the name of the author. However, the letter has traditionally been attributed to Barnabas. Clement of Alexandria (writing in the later second century) claimed that this letter was written by the Barnabas who was Paul's companion.  It is possible that Origen (writing in the third century) thought the same.

The letter was well regarded enough to have been included with the New Testament books and [*The Shepherd of Hermas*](shepherdofhermas.html) in the fourth-century Bible referred to as *Codex Sinaiticus*. Eusebius (writing in the fourth century) says that the letter was one of the rejected writings.

The date this letter was written is unknown but it is generally dated after the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. and before the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 A.D.).

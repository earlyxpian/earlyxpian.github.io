<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This translation of 2 Clement is a language update of Cyril C.
Richardson’s translation, originally translated in 1953. The langauge
update was done in 2024/2025 and was intended to make Richardson’s
translation sound more natural to a modern audience without
significantly changing the meaning of the translation. Both Richardson’s
translation and this update are in the public domain.</p>
<p>This translation was digitized and the language updated for the Early
Christian Sources project. To find more information on this translation,

of 2 Clement: An Anonymous Early Christian Sermon</h2>
<p><strong>1</strong>.1. Brothers, we ought to think of Jesus Christ
like we do of God—as the judge of the living and the dead. And we should
not make little of our salvation. 2. Because when we make little of him,
little is all we can hope to get; and people do wrong if they listen as
though to a little matter. And we do wrong also when we fail to realize
from where and by whom and into what circumstances we were called, and
how much suffering Jesus Christ endured for us. 3. How, will we repay
him then, or what could we give back that would be worthy of his gift to
us? We owe him so many holy blessings! 4. Because he has given us light;
as a Father he has called us sons; he rescued us when we were perishing.
5. How, then, will we praise him? Or how can we repay him for what we
have received? 6. Our minds were weakened and damaged; we worshiped
stone and wood and gold and silver and brass, the works of men; and our
whole life was death and nothing else. So when we were wrapped in
darkness and our eyes could not see, by his will we recovered our sight
and took off the cloud that surrounded us. 7. Because he took pity on us
and in his kindness he saved us, since he saw our great error and
destruction, and that we had no hope of salvation unless it came from
him. 8. For he called us when we were nothing, and willed our existence
from nothing.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>.1. “Rejoice, you who are barren and childless; cry
out and shout, you who were never in labor; because the deserted woman
has many more children than the one with the husband.” When he says,
“Rejoice, you who are barren and childless,” he means us; because our
assembly was fruitless before it was given children. 2. And when he
says, “Shout, you who were never in labor,” he means this: that we
should offer our prayers to God with sincerity, and not lose heart like
women in labor. 3. And he says, “The deserted woman has many more
children than the one with the husband,” because it seemed like our
people were abandoned by God. But now that we believe, we have become
more numerous than those who seemed to have God. 4. And another writing
says, “I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” 5. This means
that those who are being lost must be saved. 6. Yes, it is a great and
wonderful thing to support the things which are collapsing instead of
those which are standing. 7. So it was that the Christ was willing to
save what was being lost; and he saved many when he came and called us
who were actually perishing.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>.1. So then, seeing that he has had such compassion
for us, first of all, in that we who are alive do not sacrifice to dead
gods or worship them, but have come to know the Father of truth through
him—what is knowledge in reference to him, except to refuse to deny him
through whom we came to know the Father? 2. He himself says, “He who
acknowledges me before men, I will acknowledge before my Father.” 3.
This is our reward then, if we acknowledge him through whom we are
saved. 4. But how do we acknowledge him? By doing what he says and not
disobeying his commands; by honoring him not only with our lips, but
with all our heart and mind. And he also says in Isaiah, “This people
honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me.”</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>.1. Let’s not merely call him Lord, because that
will not save us. 2. Because he says, “Not everyone who says to me,
Lord, Lord, will be saved, but only the one who does what is right.” 3.
Therefore, brothers, let’s acknowledge him by our actions, by loving one
another, by abstaining from adultery, backbiting, and jealousy, and by
being self-controlled, compassionate, kind. We should have sympathy for
one another and should not love money. Let’s acknowledge him by acting
in this way and not by doing the opposite. 4. We should not fear men but
should fear God. 5. That is why, if you act in this way, the Lord said,
“If you are gathered with me close to my chest and do not keep my
commands, I will throw you out and will say to you: ‘Depart from me. I
do not know where you come from, you workers of lawlessness.’”</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>.1. Therefore, brothers, as we leave behind our
temporary residence in this world, let’s do the will of he who called
us, and let’s not be afraid to leave this world. 2. Because the Lord
said, “You will be like lambs among wolves.” 3. But Peter replied by
saying, “What if the wolves tear the lambs to pieces?” 4. Jesus said to
Peter: “After their death the lambs should not fear the wolves, nor
should you fear those who kill you and can do nothing more to you. But
fear him who, when you are dead, has power over soul and body to throw
them into the flames of hell.” 5. Brothers, you must realize that our
stay in this world of the flesh is small and short, but Christ’s promise
is great and wonderful, and means rest in the coming Kingdom and in
eternal life. 6. So what do we need to do to get these things, except to
lead a holy and upright life and to consider these things of the world
to be alien to us and not to desire them? 7. Because in wanting to get
these things we fall from the right way.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>.1. The Lord says, “No servant can serve two
masters.” If we want to serve both God and money, it will not do us any
good. 2. “For what good does it do a man to gain the whole world and
forfeit his life?” 3. This world and the world to come are two enemies.
4. This one means adultery, corruption, greed, and deceit, while the
other gives them up. 5. So we cannot be friends of both. To get the one,
we must give up the other. 6. We think it is better to hate what is
here, because it is insignificant, temporary, and perishable, and to
value what is there—things that are good and imperishable. 7. Yes, if we
do the will of Christ, we will find rest, but if not, nothing will save
us from eternal punishment, if we fail to pay attention to his commands.
8. Additionally, the writing also says in Ezekiel, “Though Noah and Job
and Daniel should rise, they will not save their children in captivity.”
9. If even men as upright as these cannot save their children by their
uprightness, what assurance do we have that we will enter God’s Kingdom
if we fail to keep our baptism pure and undefiled? Or who will plead for
us if we are not found to have holy and upright deeds?</p>
<p><strong>7</strong>.1. So, my brothers, let’s enter the contest,
recognizing that it is at hand and that, while many come from over seas
to perishable contests, not all of them win laurels, but only those who
have struggled hard and competed well. 2. So then, let’s compete so that
we may all be crowned. 3. Let’s run the straight race, the imperishable
contest; and let many of us sail to it and enter it, so that we may be
crowned also. And if we cannot all be crowned, let’s at least come close
to it. 4. We must realize that if a contestant in a perishable contest
is caught cheating, he is flogged, removed, and driven from the course.
5. What do you think? What will be done with the man who cheats in the
contest for the imperishable? 6. Because in reference to those who have
not guarded the seal, it says, “Their worm will not die and their fire
will not be put out, and they will be a spectacle to all flesh.”</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>.1. So while we are on earth, let’s repent. Because
we are like clay in a workman’s hands. 2. If a potter makes a vessel and
it gets out of shape or breaks in his hands, he remolds it; but once he
has thrown it into the flames of the furnace, he cannot do anything else
with it. Similarly, while we are in this world, let’s also repent with
our whole heart of the evil we have done in the flesh, so that we may be
saved by the Lord while we have a chance to repent. 3. Because once we
have left this world we cannot confess there or repent any more. 4.
Therefore, brothers, by doing the Father’s will and by keeping the flesh
pure and by obeying the Lord’s commands, we will obtain eternal life. 5.
Because the Lord says in the good message: “If you fail to guard what is
small, who will give you what is great? For I tell you that he who is
faithful in a very little, is faithful also in much.” 6. So then, this
is what he means: keep the flesh pure and the seal undefiled, so that we
may obtain eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong>.1. In addition to this, don’t let any of you say
that this flesh will not be judged or rise again. 2. Think about this:
What state were you in when you were saved? What state were you in when
you regained your sight, if it was not while you were in this flesh? 3.
Therefore we should guard the flesh as God’s temple. 4. Because just as
you were called in the flesh, you will come in the flesh. 5. If Christ
the Lord who saved us was made flesh though he was first spirit, and
called us in this way, in the same way we will also receive our reward
in this very flesh. 6. So then let’s love one another, so that we may
all come to God’s Kingdom. 7. While we have an opportunity to be healed,
let’s give ourselves over to God, the physician, and pay him in return.
8. How? By repenting with a sincere heart. 9. Because he knows
everything in advance, and realizes what is in our hearts. 10. So let’s
praise him, not with the mouth only, but from the heart, so that he may
accept us as sons. 11. Because the Lord said, “My brothers are those who
do the will of my Father.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>.1. So, my brothers, let’s do the will of the
Father who called us, so that we may have life; and let’s prefer the
pursuit of virtue. Let’s give up evil as the forerunner of our sins, and
let’s run away from ungodliness, so that evil things do not take us
over. 2. Because if we are eager to do good, peace will pursue us. 3.
This is the reason men cannot find peace. They surrender to human fears,
and they want the pleasures of the present more than the promises of the
future. 4. Because they do not realize what great torment comes with the
pleasures of the present, and what delight comes with the promises of
the future. 5. If they did these things on their own, it might be
tolerable. But they keep on teaching evil to innocent souls, and do not
realize that they and their followers will have their sentence
doubled.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong>.1. Therefore, let’s serve God with a pure heart
and we will be upright. But if, by not believing in God’s promises, we
do not serve him, we will be wretched. 2. Because the word of the
prophet says, “The double-minded are wretched, those who doubt in their
soul and say, `We have heard these things long ago, even in our fathers’
times, and day after day we have waited and have seen none of them.’ 3.
You fools! Compare yourselves to a tree. Take a vine: first it sheds its
leaves, then comes a bud, and after this a sour grape, then a ripe
bunch. 4. So my people too has had turmoils and troubles; but after that
it will receive good things.” 5. So, my brothers, we must not be
double-minded. Instead, we must patiently hold out in hope so that we
may also gain our reward. 6. Because the one who promised to pay each
one the wages due for his work can be trusted. 7. So if we have done
what is right in God’s eyes, we will enter his Kingdom and receive the
promises which no ear has heard or eye seen, or which no man’s heart has
entertained.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong>.1. Loving and doing what is right, we must be on
the watch for God’s Kingdom hour by hour, since we do not know the day
when God will appear. 2. Because when someone asked the Lord when his
Kingdom was going to come, he said, “When the two shall be one, and the
outside like the inside, and the male with the female, neither male nor
female.” 3. Now “the two” are “one” when we tell each other the truth
and two bodies harbor a single mind with no deception. 4. “The outside
like the inside” means this: “the inside” means the soul and “the
outside” means the body. Just as your body is visible, so make your soul
evident by your good deeds. 5. Furthermore “the male with the female,
neither male nor female,” means this: that when a brother sees a sister
he should not think of her gender, any more than she should think of
his. 6. When you do these things, he says, my Father’s Kingdom will
come.</p>
<p><strong>13</strong>.1. Right now, my brothers, we must repent, and be
alert for the good, because we are full of a lot of stupidity and
wickedness. We must wipe our former sins off of us and be saved by
heartfelt repentance. And we must not seek to please men or desire to
please only ourselves. But by doing what is right, let’s seek to please
even outsiders, so that the name may not be scoffed at because of us. 2.
Because the Lord says, “My name is continually scoffed at by all
peoples”; and again, “Alas for him through whom my name is scoffed at!”
How is it scoffed at? By your failing to do what I want. 3. Because when
the heathens hear God’s sayings on our lips they’re amazed at their
beauty and greatness. But after, when they note that our deeds are
unworthy of the words we say, they begin to scoff, and say that it’s a
myth and a delusion. 4. For example, when they hear from us that God
says, “It is no credit to you if you love those who love you, but it is
to your credit if you love your enemies and those who hate you,” when
they hear these things, they are amazed at such outstanding goodness.
But when they see that we fail to love not only those who hate us, but
even those who love us, then they mock at us and scoff at the name.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong>.1. So, my brothers, by doing the will of God our
Father we will belong to the first assembly, the spiritual one, which
was created before the sun and the moon. But if we fail to do the Lord’s
will, that writing which says, “My house has become a robber’s den” will
apply to us. So, then, we must choose to belong to the assembly of life
in order to be saved. 2. I do not suppose that you are unaware that the
living assembly is the body of Christ. Because the writing says, “God
made man male and female.” The male is Christ; the female is the
assembly. Additionally, the books and the apostles say that the assembly
is not limited to the present, but existed from the beginning. Because
it was spiritual, as our Jesus was, and was made manifest in the last
days to save us. 3. Indeed, the assembly which is spiritual was made
manifest in the flesh of Christ, and so indicates to us that if any of
us guard it in the flesh and do not corrupt it, he will get it in return
by the Holy Spirit. For this flesh is the copy of the spirit. As a
result, no one who has corrupted the copy will share in the reality.
This, then, is what it means, brothers: Guard the flesh so that you may
share in the spirit. 4. Now, if we say that the assembly is the flesh
and the Christ is the spirit, then whoever does violence to the flesh,
does violence to the assembly. Someone like that, then, will not share
in the spirit, which is Christ. 5. This flesh is able to share in so
great a life and immortality, because the Holy Spirit clings to it. Nor
can one express or tell what things the Lord has prepared for his chosen
ones.</p>
<p><strong>15</strong>.1. In my opinion, the advice I have given about
self-control is not unimportant; and if a man acts on it, he will not
regret it, but will save himself as well as me who advised him. Because
to convert a soul who is straying and perishing so that they may be
saved comes with no small reward. 2. For this is how we can pay back God
who created us, if the one who speaks and the one who hears do so with
faith and love. 3. As a result, we must remain true to our faith and be
upright and holy, so that we can make requests to God in confidence. He
says, “Even while you are speaking, I will say, ‘See, here I am.’” 4.
Surely this saying is a sign of a great promise; because the Lord says
of himself that he is more ready to give than we are to ask. 5. So then,
let’s take our share of such great kindness and not begrudge each other
the obtaining of such great blessings. Because these sayings hold in
store as much pleasure for those who act on them, as they do
condemnation for those who ignore them.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong>.1. So, brothers, since we have been given no
small opportunity to repent, let’s take the occasion to turn to God who
has called us, while we still have One to accept us. 2. Because if we
renounce these pleasures and master our souls by avoiding their evil
desires, we will share in Jesus’s mercy. 3. Understand that the day of
judgment is already on its way like a blazing furnace, and the powers of
heaven will dissolve and the whole earth will be like lead melting in
fire. Men’s secret and public actions will then be made clear. 4. So,
charity, like repentance from sin, is a good thing. But fasting is
better than prayer, and charity is better than both. Love covers a
multitude of sins, and prayer, arising from a good conscience, rescues
from death. Everyone who abounds in these things is blessed, because
charity lightens sin.</p>
<p><strong>17</strong>.1. So, let’s repent with our whole heart, so that
none of us will be lost. Because if we have been commanded to do this
too—to draw men away from idols and instruct them—how much more wrong is
it for the soul which already knows God to perish? 2. Consequently we
must help one another and bring back those who are weak in goodness, so
that we may all be saved; and let’s convert and warn one another.</p>
<p>3. We should not only appear to be believing and attentive right now,
while the elders are preaching to us. But when we go home, we should
keep the Lord’s commands in mind and not be diverted by worldly
passions. Instead, we should strive to come here more often and progress
in the Lord’s commands, so that with a common mind we may all be
gathered together to gain life. 4. For the Lord said, “I am coming to
gather together all peoples, clans, and tongues.” This refers to the day
of his appearing, when he will come to redeem us, each according to his
deeds. 5. And unbelievers will see his glory and power, and they will be
surprised to see the sovereignty of the world given to Jesus, and they
will say, “How sad for us, because you really did exist, and we didn’t
recognize it or believe, and we did not obey the elders who preached to
us our salvation.” And “their worm will not die and their fire will not
be put out, and they will be a spectacle to all flesh.” 6. He refers to
that day of judgment when men will see those who were ungodly among us
and who twisted the commands of Jesus Christ. 7. But the upright who
have done good and patiently endured tortures and hated the pleasures of
the soul, when they see those who have deviated and denied Jesus in word
and action being punished with dreadful torments and undying fire, will
give glory to their God and say, “There is hope for him who has served
God with his whole heart.”</p>
<p><strong>18</strong>.1. As a result, we must also be among those who
give thanks and have served God, and not of the ungodly who are
sentenced. 2. As for me, I too am a grave sinner, and have not yet
escaped temptation. I am still surrounded by the devil’s devices, though
I am anxious to pursue righteousness. My aim is to manage at least to
approach it, because I am afraid of the judgment to come.</p>
<p><strong>19</strong>.1. So, my brothers and sisters, following the God
of truth, I am reading you an exhortation to pay attention to what was
written there, so that you may save yourselves and your reader. For
compensation I beg you to repent with all your heart, granting
yourselves salvation and life. By doing this we will set a goal for all
the young who want to be active in the cause of religion and of God’s
goodness. 2. Additionally, we should not be so stupid as to be
displeased and irritated when anyone warns us and turns us from
wickedness to righteousness. There are times when we do wrong
unknowingly because of the double-mindedness and unbelief in our hearts,
and our understanding is darkened by empty desires. 3. So then, let’s do
what is right so that we may finally be saved. Those who observe these
instructions are blessed; although they suffer briefly in this world,
they will gather the immortal fruit of the resurrection. 4. A religious
man must not be downcast if he is miserable now. A time of blessedness
is waiting for him. He will live again with the fathers above, and will
rejoice in an eternity that knows no sorrow.</p>
<p><strong>20</strong>.1. But you must not be troubled in your minds by
the fact that we see the wicked in prosperity while God’s slaves are in
difficult circumstances. 2. Brothers and sisters, we must have faith. We
are engaged in the contest of the living God and are being trained by
the present life in order to win laurels in the life to come. 3. None of
the upright has gotten his reward quickly, but he waits for it. 4.
Because if God were to give the righteous their reward right away, we
would be engaged in a business venture with God rather than training in
godliness. Because we would give an appearance of uprightness, but would
be pursuing profit and not piety. That is why the divine judgment
punishes a spirit which is not upright, and loads it with chains.</p>
<p>5. To the only invisible God, the Father of truth, who dispatched to
us the Saviour and prince of immortality, through whom he also disclosed
to us the truth and the heavenly life—to him be glory forever and ever.
Amen.</p>
